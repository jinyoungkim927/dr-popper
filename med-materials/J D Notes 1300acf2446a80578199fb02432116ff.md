# J.D Notes

- Cases are organised by the discipline which they most commonly appeared. Faculty can ask any variation of those cases within any of the disciplines so the notes generally covered all possibilities. This is way more than is needed but included for completeness (if new cases).
  - Memorandums are more high-yield than Case Protocols from previous experience. There are a lot more questions than what is often asked (4 questions are asked and marked on). These are here for completeness sake. Have a look at previous memorandums to see what the key questions asked are.
- Colour-coded
  - Green = high-yield (asked in multiple years/recent years)
  - Yellow = medium yield
  - Red = low yield
- Whitebook Summaries included below as well as additional notes made to cover gaps highlighted by the learning outcomes but not yet covered in cases (low yield)
