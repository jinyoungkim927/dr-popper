# Osteomyelitis

- Definition
    - Inflammation of bone and marrow
    - Most common causes
        - Pyogenic bacteria
        - M. tuberculosis
- Pyogenic osteomyelitis
    - Causative organisms
        - S. aureus is the most common
            - Able to express adhesins to attach to bone matrix
        - In neonates
            - E. coli and GBS
        - In trauma, anaerobes and mixed bacterial infections are common
    - Routes of infection
        - Haematogenous dissemination (most common)
        - Extension from an infection in an adjacent joint or soft tissue
        - Traumatic implantation after compound fracture or orthopaedic procedures
    - Clinical features
        - Throbbing pain over the affected region
        - Acute systemic illness
            - Malaise, fever, leukocytosis
    - Investigative approach
        - High degree of suspicion in new or worsening MSK pain + fever + bacteraemia + risk factors (trauma, recent surgery, septic arthritis)
        - Principal diagnostic investigations
            - Gold standard is biopsy and bone culture to identify the pathogen
            - Blood cultures
                - Identify likely pathogen (S. aureus) in context of clinical symptoms
            - Bone X-ray
                - Destructive lytic lesion with surrounding oedema and sclerotic rim
        - Ancillary
            - Bedside
            - Labs
                - FBC (raised WCC)
                - Inflammatory markers (CRP)
    - Pathology
        - Acute
            - Bacteria proliferate and induce an acute inflammatory reaction with necrosis
                - Entrapped bone becomes necrotic and called a **sequestrum**
            - Periosteal involvement as bacteria can percolate through Haversian systems
                - Can impair blood supply to affected region → suppurative necrosis and infarction which causes segmental bone necrosis
                - **Rupture of periosteum can result in surrounding abscess which can cause a draining sinus**
        - Chronic
            - Chronic inflammatory cells predominate and stimulate reactive bone formation
                - Can form a shell around sequestrum and form a **involucrum**
                - Viable organisms can persist in the sequestrum
    - Management
        - Antibiotics
            - Empirical antibiotics
                - Low risk of MRSA
                    - **Flucloxacillin 2g IV Q6h**
                    - If hypersensitivity to penicillins
                        - Non-severe: cefazolin
                        - Severe: vancomycin
                - High risk of MRSA
                    - **Vancomycin IV**
            - Duration of therapy
                - **4 weeks IV followed by ≥ 2 weeks oral**
        - **Surgical debridement of infection**
    - Complications
        - Acute
            - Infection can spread:
                - Suppurative arthritis
                - Vertebral osteomyelitis → destruction of intervertebral discs
                - Abscess of surrounding tissue
            - Sepsis
        - Chronic osteomyelitis
            - Sinus tract formation
            - Pathological fractures and bone deformities
            - Secondary amyloidosis
            - Increased cancer risk (SCC if sinus tract, osteosarcoma)
