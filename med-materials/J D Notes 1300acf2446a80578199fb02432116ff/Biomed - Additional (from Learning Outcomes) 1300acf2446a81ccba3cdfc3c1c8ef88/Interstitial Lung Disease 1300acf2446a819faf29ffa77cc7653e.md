# Interstitial Lung Disease

- Definition
    - Heterogenous group of disorders characterised predominantly by bilateral, often patchy, and chronic involvement of pulmonary connective tissue
        - Often the most peripheral and delicate interstitium in alveolar walls
        - May have intra-alveolar and interstitial components (frequent overlap in symptoms)
    - Clinical features
        - Hallmark is reduced compliance (more effort required to expand lungs)
            - **Dyspnoea**
        - Hypoxia
            - Due to damage to alveolar epithelium and vasculature → V/Q mismatch
        - Can lead to respiratory failure associated with cor pulmonale or pulmonary hypertension
        - Fine crackles on respiratory auscultation is classic
    - Pathogenesis
        - Cyclical injury to the epithelium of alveoli resulting in macrophage activation and release of fibrogenic cytokines (e.g. TGF-B)

                    - Restrictive patterns of lung disease → dyspnoea which can progress to respiratory failure
                    - Common pathogenesis
                        - Particulate matter results in inflammation within the lungs → fibrotic relations
                            - Pulmonary alveolar macrophages are key to initiating and perpetuating lung injury and fibrosis
                                - Release IL1 which exacerbates fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition
                    - Asbestosis
                        - Two main types of asbestos: serpentine (more common) and amphibole (more pathogenic)
                            - Cause fibrosis through interacting with pulmonary macrophages
                            - Adsorbs carcinogens from tobacco smoke and exacerbate risk of lung carcinoma

- Pathology of IPF
    - Characterised by patchy but progressive bilateral interstitial fibrosis
        - More common in males and age > 60
    - Macroscopic
        - Pleural surface may have cobblestoning appearance due to retraction of scars along interlobular septa
        - Fibrosis in cut surface (distributed subpleurally and along interlobular septa)
    - Microscopic
        - Patchy interstitial fibrosis which varies in intensity and worsens with time
        - **Fibroblastic foci** in early lesions (fibroblast proliferation)
            - Become less cellular and more collagenous over time
        - Dense fibrosis causes collapse of alvoelar walls and formation of cystic spaces
            - **Honeycomb fibrosis**
        - Interstitial inflammation
            - Patchy with alveolar septal infiltrate of mostly lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells
        - Secondary pulmonary hypertensive changes (intimal fibrosis, medial thickening of pulmonary arteries)
