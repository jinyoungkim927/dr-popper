# Gout

- Caused by excessive amounts of uric acid (end product of purine metabolism) within tissues and body fluids
    - Monosodium urate crystals precipitate from supersaturated body fluids → acute inflammatory reaction
    - Affects 1% of the population and more common in males
- Risk factors
    - Non-modifiable
        - Renal failure
        - Conditions with increased nucleic acid turnover (e.g. leukaemias)
        - Genetic factors (FHx, PMHx of gout)
    - Modifiable
        - Obesity
        - Excess alcohol intake
        - Consumption of purine rich foods
        - Metabolic syndrome
- Investigative approach
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - Arthrocentesis with synovial fluid aspirate
            - Definitive → excludes septic arthritis and CPPD
            - Synovial fluid WBC often ≥ 2000/mm^3 (or ≥ 2x10^9/L)
                - PMNs predominant
            - Monosodium urate crystals (needle-shaped) which are negative birefringent on polarised light confirms the diagnosis
    - Ancillary
        - Serum uric acid level
            - Obtain around 2 weeks after resolution of the attack
            - A level > 360microm/L confirms a diagnosis (however should correlate with clinical Sx)
        - Ultrasound (look for erosions and tophi)
        - X-ray of affected joint (periarticular erosions)
- Pathogenesis
    - Urate crystals are thought to activate the complement system and lead to chemotactic and pro-inflammatory mediators
        - Phagocytosed by macrophages which activates an inflammatory cascade (IL-1 mediated)
        - Cells are activated and lead to the release of a host of additional mediators (e.g. chemokines, cytokines, free radicals, leukotrienes)
            - Can activate synovial cells and cartilage cells to release proteases that exacerbate tissue injury
    - Four stages
        - Asymptomatic hyperuricaemia
        - Acute gouty arthritis
            - Sudden onset, excruciating joint pain
                - Localised erythema and warmth
            - Often monoarticular for first attack (50% in first MTP) or ankle, heel, wrist
        - Intercritical gout
            - Asymptomatic period but individuals are predisposed to a second attack which recur at shorter intervals
            - Frequently become polyarticular
        - Chronic tophaceous gout
            - Characteristic juxta-articular bone erosions (crystal deposits and loss of joint space)

- Morphology
    - Acute arthritis
        - Dense neutrophilic infiltrate permeating synovium and synovial fluid
        - Oedema and congestion
    - Chronic tophaceous arthritis
        - Repetitive precipitation of urate crystals during acute attacks
        - Hyperplastic, fibrotic and thickened synovium (forms a pannus which destroys underlying cartilage)
            - Results in juxta-articular bone erosions
        - Tophi are pathognomonic
            - Large aggregations of urate crystals surrounded by an intense inflammatory reaction of lymphocytes, macrophages and giant cells
            - Tend to occur in peripheral locations (lower temperatures and decreased saturation)
