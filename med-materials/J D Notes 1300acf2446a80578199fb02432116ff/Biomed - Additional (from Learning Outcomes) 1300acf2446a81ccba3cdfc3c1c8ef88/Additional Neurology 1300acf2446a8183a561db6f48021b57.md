- Primary headaches
    - Primary
        - *tension-type*
            - clinical presentation: bitemporal/circumferential, “tight”/”squeezing” pain.
            - treatment: paracetamol
        - *migraine*
            - clinical presentation: unilateral, pulsatile headache often associated with nausea/vomiting, photophobia/sensitivity to noise and/or aura in 25% of cases
                - aura: reversible neurological abnormalities, e.g., visual field defects, paresis
                - NB: causes significant functional deficits
            - abortive therapy: NSAIDs & anti-emetics, or triptans (serotonin agonist → cause vasodilation)
            - prophylactic therapy: B blockers, CCB (verapamil), anti-convulsants (topiramate), pizotifen (serotonin antagonist)
        - *cluster*
            - *clinical presentation: recurrent brief (15min to 3 hours) attacks of agonising unilateral, retro-orbital, associated with autonomic signs (including facial flushing, conjunctival injection, lacrimation, rhinnorhea)*
            - *abortive treatment: oxygen and/or triptans*
            - *prophylaxis: CCB (verapamil)*
        - *trigeminal neuralgia (AKA tic douloureux)*
            - *clinical presentation: very brief (seconds) attacks of “stabbing” facial pain in the distribution of 1 or more distributions of the trigeminal nerve. may occur up to 100 times in one day. Often triggered by jaw claudication,*
            - *aetiology: compression of the nerve*
            - *treatment: anti-convulsants (carbamazepine) and/or alcohol injection*
    - *secondary*
        - *giant-cell AKA temporal arteritis*
            - *clinical presentation: temporal headache +/- amaurosis fugax & constitutional signs*
            - *aetiology: inflammatory*
            - *treatment: high dose steroids*
    
    Red flags for any headache
    
    - patient
        - new headache >50yo
        - pregnancy/post-partum (pre-eclampsia)
        - fever
    - headache
        - sudden-onset severe (SAH)
        - focal neurological deficit (stroke, SOL)
        - progressive worsening (SOL)
        - confusion or decreased LOC
        - meningeal signs
        - seizures
        - psychiatric/cognitive symptoms
        - signs of increased ICP
- Parkinson’s Disease
    - Normal circuitry of the basal ganglia
        - Movement is initiated by the motor cortex
            - The thalamus plays a key role in motor control through exciting the motor cortex however unregulated thalamic activity = uncontrolled motion
            - The thalamus is regulated by the basal ganglia
        - The globus pallidus is tonically active and inhibits the excitatory activity of the thalamus
        - Direct and indirect loops integrate different basal structures to achieve an appropriate balance of inhibition and excitation of the thalamus
            - Regulated by glutamate (excitatory) and GABA (inhibitory)
        - Direct loop → reduced inhibition on thalamus by GPi → increased movement

        - Indirect loop → loss of inhibition on subthalamic nucleus by GPe → increases inhibitory effect of GPi on thalamus → suppression of unnecessary movement

    - Direct and indirect loop work in tandem and are influenced by the activity of dopamine synthesised by the substantia nigra
        - Nigrostriatal projections from the SN pars compacta modulates the direct and indirect pathways via the release of dopamine
            - Dopamine affects the two loops in different ways with the net effect that it favours the activity of the direct loop → facilitates movement
        - Effect on direct loop
            - Dopamine acts on D1 receptors on the GABAergic neurons of the striatum → causes release of GABA to GPi → disinhibition of the thalamus
            - Dopamine acts on D2 receptors on the GABAergic neurons of the striatum → reduction in the release of GABA to the GPe → more inhibition of STN → less excitation of GPi → disinhibition of thalamus
        - **In Parkinson’s Disease, degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the SNc and nigrostriatal tracts leads to difficulty initiating movement and decreased movements**
