# Diabetic foot ulcer

- Aetiology
    - Acute infections most commonly due to S. aureus or Streptococcus spp.
        - If antibiotics given recently, higher risk of Gram-negative pathogens
    - Chronic infections (≥ 4 weeks or more) are often polymicrobial
        - Involve Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria
- Assessment
    - Criteria for an infected ulcer (IWGDF and IDSA)
        - ≥ 2 of the following need to be present
            - Local swelling or induration (1)
            - Erythema extending ≥ 0.5cm in any direction from the wound (1)
            - **Local tenderness, pain (1)**
            - **Local warmth (1)**
            - Purulent discharge (1)
    - Criteria for infection severity (IWGDF and IDSA)
        - Mild
            - Involves skin and subcutaneous tissue AND erythema ≤ 2cm from wound margin
            - No systemic signs of infection
        - Moderate
            - Involves deeper structures (muscle, bone, tendon) or erythema > 2cm from wound margin
            - No SIRS response
        - **Severe**
            - **Associated with SIRS**
    - **Do not collect specimens from non-infected ulcers**
        - Can consider tissue samples via biopsy or aspiration to guide antibiotic therapy
- Management
    - Antibiotics should only be used for non-infected ulcers
    - Mild diabetic foot + no recent antibiotics + low MRSA risk
        - PO flucloxacillin QID
            - Use cefalexin PO QID if delayed non-severe hypersensitivity
            - Use TMP-SMX if high risk of MRSA
        - If recent antibiotics or chronic infection
            - Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid PO BD
    - Moderate infection at low risk of MRSA
        - Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid IV TDS
            - Consider if hypersensitivity
                - Cefazolin 2g IV TDS
                - Metronidazole 500mg IV BD
        - Total duration of 1-2 weeks (IV and oral) is sufficient however may require longer if deep issues involved
    - Severe
        - Piperacillin (4g) + tazobactam (0.5g) IV QID
            - If hypersensivity
                - Consider ciprofloxacin IV + clindamycin IV
        - Vancomycin may be required for severe limb or life-threatening infection if MRSA risk
        - Duration: 3 weeks is often sufficient but monitor response especially if deeper tissues are involved
