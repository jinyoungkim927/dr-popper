# Heart Failure

- Definition and categories
    - Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome which results from either functional or structural impairment of ventricles resulting in symptomatic LV dysfunction
    - Symptoms are due to inadequate cardiac output which is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the body
    - Categories
        - Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
            - EF ≤ 40%
        - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)
            - EF ≥ 50%
        - Heart failure with mid-range EF (HFmrEF)
            - EF between 40-50%
- Causes
    - Most common causes
        - Ischaemic heart disease
        - COPD
            - Smoking leads to increased CAD risk
            - Can result in pulmonary hypertension and RHF
        - Hypertension
        - Cardiomyopathy
        - Rheumatic heart disease (developing countries)
    - Coronary artery disease (CAD)
        - Chronic and acute ischaemia causes direct damage to the myocardium and leads to remodelling and scar formation
            - Results in inadequate relaxation in diastole and impaired contraction in systole
                - Decreases contractility and cardiac output
        - Scar formation may correlate with aneurysm formation which further impairs contractile formation and relaxation
        - Myocardial infarction causes dyssynchronous contraction of the infarcted segment, subsequent remodelling of the ventricle, ventricular dilation with annular dilation, mitral regurgitation which predispose to HF and CO
    - Hypertension
        - Higher afterload results in an compensatory hypertrophy of the cardiac muscle to maintain normal CO
            - With continued uncontrolled BP, apoptosis and fibrosis may result
            - LVH increases myocardial stiffness and can cause ischaemia → HFrEF and HFpEF
    - Valvular heart disease
        - Aortic and pulmonary stenosis can increase afterload and may cause AF
        - In regurgitation, persistent volume overload can cause enlargement and functional impairment
    - Cardiomyopathies
        - Disease of functional and structural heart muscle abnormalities in the absence of other causes (e.g. CAD, HTN, valvular)
        - Can be divided into five types which can each be genetic or acquired
            - Dilated (e.g. alcoholic)
            - Hypertrophic (e.g. AD HOCM)
            - Restrictive (e.g. cardiac amyloidosis)
            - Arrhythmogenic right ventricular
            - Unclassified (e.g. Takotsubo)
- Physiology
    - Performance of LV function and stroke volume is related to preload (venous return and ventricular EDV) and afterload (resistance during ejection from aorta and wall stress)
    - Frank-Starling curve explains the relationship between SV or CO and left ventricle end-diastolic volume
        - Steep positive relationship between increased cardiac filling pressures and increased SV and CO
        - In heart failure, the Frank-Starling curve is right-shifted
            - This represents decreased contractility and a higher pressure is required to achieved the same cardiac output
            - In advanced disease, the curve is flattened which suggests that augmentation in venous return and LVEDP fails to increase stroke volume
    - In HFpEF
        - Same underlying pathophysiology to HFrEF however it occurs in response to increased ventricular stiffness and altered relaxation than abnormalities of CO in HFrEF
            - Results in concentric LVH
            - Shifts the pressure-volume curve to the left
    - HF causes activation of the neurohumoral systems to maintain perfusion of vital organs
        - SNS
            - HF causes decreased carotid baroreceptor response which increases SNS and thus, cardiac contractility and HR, vasoconstriction and increased afterload
        - RAAS
            - Activation of RAAS with low renal perfusion from HF causes salt and water retention + increases preload (aldosterone + ADH)
            - Also increases Ang II which leads to vasoconstriction and more salt and water retention
                - These components stress the ventricular wall and cause dilatation (remodelling) and worsen ventricular function
        - ADH
        - Other vasoactive substances (brain natriuretic peptide, NO, endothelin)
    - All these compensatory mechanisms in HF cause negative remodelling of the heart (inflammation, apoptosis, hypertrophy, fibrosis)
        - Worsens LV function
- Investigative approach
    - Largely a clinical diagnosis based on careful history, physical examination, laboratory and imaging data
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - ECG
            - May show previous MI, arrhythmias, LV hypertrophy
        - Transthoracic echocardiogram
            - Aids the diagnosis of HF and classify HF by ejection fraction
        - BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP
            - Supports the clinical diagnosis of HF (ambulatory patient) and supports the diagnosis of acutely decompensated HF (hospitalised)
    - Ancillary
        - Labs
            - FBC (rule our anaemia as a cause of symptoms)
            - UEC and CMP
                - Hyponatraemia in chronic HF
                - Renal dysfunction (medication response, secondary to HF)
            - Fasting BGLs, lipid profiles
            - LFTs
            - TFTs
            - Consider genetic testing for cardiomyopathies
        - Imaging
            - CXR (findings relevant to HF)
            - Consider cardiac CT or MRI
                - Can help evaluate coronary arteries
                - MRI can aid with identification of aetiology (infiltrative, ischaemic, hypertrophic)

            - ARNI
                - e.g. sacubitril (neprilysin inhibitor) + valsartan (ARB)
                - Mechanism
                    - Sacubitril blocks the action of neprilysin which prevents the breakdown of natriuretic peptides (prolongs favourable effects)
                        - **The natriuretic system antagonises RAAS promotes vasodilation, natriuresis and diuresis**
                            - Decreases BP, lowers SNS tone, reduces aldosterone levels
                    - Neprilysin also breaks down Ang II and thus, combination with ARB is necessary to block the effect of excess Ang II
                        - Also prevents breakdown of bradykinin and cannot be used with ACEi due to risk of angioedema
                - Use
