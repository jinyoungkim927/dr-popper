# CT Moodle Cases

- Prostate
    - The prostate gland is around 3cm in diameter and the prostatic urethra is around 3cm long
        - Prostate is on top of the urogenital diaphragm
    - The subpubic angle may be accentuated in BPH
        - The ejaculatory ducts pass superior and to the side of the posterior median groove
    - Colliculus seminalis (veru montanum) is an internal feature on the posterior wall of the prostate urethra
        - Visible as an elevation around halfway down the posterior ridge of the wall (urethral crest)
        - Utricle opens at the summit of the colliculus seminalis with ejaculatory ducts opening on either side
    - During a TURP, removing tissue proximal to the colliculus seminalis is preferred as removing tissue inferior risks damaging the external urethral sphincter
        - Haemorrhage risk is significant but only if the fibrous sheath of the prostate is breached resulting in compromise of the prostatic venous plexus
    - Tumour spreads to the subcapsular plexus → pelvic venous plexus → internal vertebral venous plexus (along vertebral column)
        - Rarely invades rectum due to the rectovesical fascia which is a barrier to posterior invasion
