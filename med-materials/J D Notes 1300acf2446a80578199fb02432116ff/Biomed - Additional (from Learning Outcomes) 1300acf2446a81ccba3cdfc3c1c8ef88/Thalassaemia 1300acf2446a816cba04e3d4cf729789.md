# Thalassaemia

- Alpha-thalassaemia
    - A-globin deletion on chromosome 16 → decreased a-globin synthesis
        - Normal is aa/aa
    - Epidemiology
        - Cis deletions (on same chromosome) prevalent in Asian populations
        - Trans deletions (on separate chromosome) prevalent in African populations
    - Types
        
        
        | Number of a-globin genes deleted | Disease | Clinical outcome |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | (aa/a-) | a-thalassaemia minima | No anaemia (silent carrier) |
        | (a-/a-) **trans** or (aa/—) **cis** | a-thalassaemia minor | **Mild microcytic, hypochromic anaemia.** Cis deletion has more reproductive implications (worsens outcomes) |
        | (—/-a) | HbH disease → excess B-globin forms B4 | Moderate to severe microcytic hypochromic anaemia |
        | (—/—) | Hb Barts disease (excess y-globin forms y4) | Hydrops fetalis → incompatible with life |
    - Pathology
        - Loss of a-globin genes results in relative excess of B-globin or y-globin (in early life)
            - Form stable B4 (HbH) and y4 tetramers (Hb Bart) which cause less membrane damage than free a-globin chains in B-thalassaemia
                - Ineffective erythropoiesis is less pronounced
            - **HbH and Hb Bart both have high O2 affinity and are ineffective at delivering O2 to the tissues**
- Beta-thalassaemia
    - Point mutations on chromosome 11 → decreased B-globin synthesis
        - More common in Mediterranean populations
    - Types
        - B-thalassaemia minor (heterozygous)
            - B-chain is underproduced = often asymptomatic
            - Diagnosis:
                - Increased HbA2 (> 3.5%) on electrophoresis
        - B-thalassaemia major (homozygous)
            - B-chain is absent
                - Increased HbF (a2y2) and HbA2 (a2d2)
                    - **Disease often manifests after 6 months of life when HbF disappears (protective)**
            - Pathogenesis of anaemia
                - Reduced B-globin = production of poorly haemoglobinised RBCs which are pale and small
                - Excess unpaired a-globin chains in B-thalassaemia aggregate and damage RBC membranes → intravascular haemolysis
                    - Destroys RBC precursors → ineffective erythropoiesis
                        - **Results in excess iron absorption and overload**
            - Clinical features
                - Severe microcytic and hypochromic anaemia with target cells and increased anisopoikilocytosis
                    - Requires blood transfusion
                        - Can result in secondary haemochromatosis
                - Marrow expansion → skeletal deformities (e.g. chipmunk facies)
                - Hepatosplenomegaly due to extramedullary haematopoiesis

- Investigative approach
    - Principal diagnostic
        - FBC
            - Low Hb and low MCV
        - Iron studies to rule out iron deficiency anaemia
        - Peripheral blood smear
            - Target cells + microcytic and hypochromic cells
        - Hb electrophoresis
            - B-thalassaemia major
                - Higher HbA2 and HbF levels with absent or low HbA
            - B-thalassaemia minor
                - Mild elevation of HbA2 and mild decrease of HbA
        - DNA analysis to confirm mutations
