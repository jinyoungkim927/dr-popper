- Types of asthma
    - Atopic (most common)
        - Type I IgE-mediated hypersensitivity

    - Non-atopic
        - No evidence of allergen sensitisation
        - Respiratory infections (e.g. virus) or inhaled air pollutants are common triggers
            - Thought that virus-induced inflammation of respiratory mucosa lowers the threshold of the subepithelial vagal receptors to irritants
    - Drug-induced
        - Aspirin can provoke asthma (thought to be due to shunting of LTs with PG blockage)
