# Atherosclerosis and Vascular Injury

- Arteriolosclerosis
    - Affects small arteries and arterioles → may cause downstream ischaemic injury
        - Hyaline arteriolosclerosis
            - Typical of benign hypertension
                - Homogenous, pink hyaline thickening of arteriolar walls with loss of underlying structural detail and luminal narrowing
            - Due to leakage of plasma components across injured endothelial cells into vessel walls and increased ECM production by smooth muscle cells in chronic haemodynamic stress
        - Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis
            - Typical of severe hypertension
            - Vessels exhibit “onion-skin” concentric laminated thickening of arteriolar walls and luminal narrowing
                - Laminations consist of smooth muscle cells and thickened, reduplicated basement membrane
            - In malignant hypertension, these changes are accompanied by fibrinoid deposits and vessel wall necrosis (necrotising arteriolitis)

- Vascular response to injury
    - Vascular injury leading to endothelial cell loss or dysfunction stimulates smooth muscle cell growth and associated matrix synthesis
        - Healing of injured vessels involves the migration of smooth muscle cells or smooth muscle precursors into the intima
            - These cells proliferate, and synthesise ECM similar to the action of fibroblasts (form a neointima covered by an intact endothelial layer)
    - Intimal thickening is hence a stereotypical response of the vessel wall to insult
        - Neointimal cells cannot contract like smooth muscle cells but are able to divide and proliferate
            - Proliferative activity is regulated by growth factors and cytokines from platelets, endothelial cells and macrophages
            - Return to a non-proliferative state with restoration and/or normalisation of the endothelial cell layer
        - However, the healing response results in irreversible intimal thickening
            - With persistent or recurrent insults, further thickening can result in vessel stenosis
        - Note: although a normal process of ageing, this age-related intimal change is often of no consequence due to compensatory outward remodelling of the vessel → little net change in luminal diameter
- Atherosclerosis
    - Presence of intimal lesions (atheromas) which are composed of soft lipid cores (cholesterol + necrosis) covered with fibrous caps
    - Pathogenesis
        - Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the arterial wall to endothelial injury (response-to-injury hypothesis). The following events are involved:
            - Endothelial injury and resultant dysfunction
                - Leads to increased permeability, leukocyte adhesion and thrombosis
            - Accumulation of lipoproteins in the vessel wall (oxidised LDL and cholesterol primarily)
            - Platelet adhesion
            - Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, migration into the intima, differentiation into macrophages and foam cells
            - Lipid accumulation within macrophages
            - Smooth muscle cell recruitment due to factors released from activated platelets, macrophages and endothelium
                - Smooth muscle proliferation and ECM production
        - Endothelial injury
            - Response to injury is intimal hyperplasia (cause may be mechanical, immune complex, chemical)
                - Triggers of early lesions may be hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, cigarette toxins, infectious agents
            - Haemodynamic disturbances
                - Plaques tend to occur at ostia of exiting vessels, branch walls, posterior wall of aorta (turbulent blood flow)
            - Lipids
                - Typically transported in the bloodstream bound to apoproteins (form lipoprotein complexes)
                    - Dominant lipids in atheromas are cholesterol and cholesterol esters
                - How does dyslipidaemia contribute to atherogenesis
                    - Chronic hyperlipidaemia (esp. hypercholesterolaemia) can directly impair endothelial cell function
                        - Increases local O2 free radical production
                            - Accelerate NO decay and reduce vasodilation
                        - Lipoproteins accumulate in the intima and are thought to form oxidised LDL and cholesterol crystals (thought to be secondary to inflammatory cells)
        - Inflammation
            - Dysfunctional endothelial cells express adhesion molecules which promote leukocyte adhesion (esp. monocytes, T cells)
                - After adhesion, cells migrate into the intima under the influence of locally produced chemokines
            - Monocytes → macrophages → phagocytose lipoproteins (LDL, cholesterol)
                - Become activated and produce ROS (more oxidised LDL) and inflammatory growth factors (smooth muscle proliferation)
            - T lymphocytes recruited into intimal contribute to chronic inflammation and continuous macrophage activation (e.g. IFN-ysecretion)
        - Smooth muscle proliferation and matrix synthesis
            - Intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and ECM deposition leads to conversion of the earliest lesion (fatty streak) into a mature atheroma
                - Contributes to the progressive growth of lesions
            - Can originate from media or circulating precursors (have a unique and distinct proliferative and synthetic phenotype)
                - Synthesise ECM which stabilises plaques
                - Activated inflammatory cells however can also cause apoptosis and breakdown of matrix → unstable plaques

    - Morphology
        - Fatty streaks
            - Begin as yellow, minute, flat macules which coalesce into elongated lesions (≥ 1cm in length)
                - Composed of lipid-filled foamy macrophages
                - Do not cause significant flow disturbance
            - Reversible however some can evolve into plaques
        - Atherosclerotic plaque
            - Intimal thickening and lipid accumulation
                - White to yellow raised lesions, may coalesce to form larger masses
                - Superimposed thrombus imparts a red-brown colour
            - Patchy and eccentric lesions (may be due to local haemodynamic disturbances)
            - Most commonly involves:
                - Infrarenal AA
                - Coronary arteries
                - Popliteal arteries
                - ICA
                - Circle of Willis
            - General appearance
                - Superficial fibrous cap (smooth muscle, dense collagen)
                - Shoulder (cellular region with inflammatory cells)
                - Necrotic core (lipid, debris, foam cells, smooth muscle cells, fibrin)
                - May have neovascularisation at the periphery
    - Clinical consequences
        - Occlusion of smaller vessels → ischaemia
        - Plaque rupture → expose atherosclerotic debris (acute thrombosis or distal embolisation)
            - Causes
                - Rupture or fissuring (expose thrombogenic plaque constituents)
                - Erosion or ulceration (expose subendothelial BM)
                - Haemorrhage into atheroma (expands volume)
                    - Rupture of fibrous cap or neovascularised vessels
        - Destruction of underlying vessel wall → aneurysm formation (secondary rupture or thrombosis)
            - Due to atherosclerosis induced pressure or ischaemic atrophy of underlying media
                - Also loss of elastic tissue which causes structural weakening (aneurysmal dilation and rupture)
