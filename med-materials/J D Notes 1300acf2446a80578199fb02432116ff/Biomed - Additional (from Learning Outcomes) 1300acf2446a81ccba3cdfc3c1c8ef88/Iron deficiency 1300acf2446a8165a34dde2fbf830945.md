# Iron deficiency

- Causes
    - Inadequate intake
        - Diet (haem iron from animal sources are more readily absorbed)
            - Excess milk or juice intake in children
        - Malabsorption
            - Coeliac disease
            - Atrophic gastritis
            - Chronic PPI or antibiotic use
    - Excessive losses
        - Bleeding from any site (most Fe in RBCs)
            - Occult GI bleeding, parasitic
            - Blood donations
            - Heavy menstrual bleeding
            - Pregnancy and childbirth
- Physiology
    - Absorbed in small intestine via DMT1 in enterocytes
        - If body stores are adequate
            - Sequestered as ferritin
        - If iron levels are low
            - Fe is bound to transferrin via ferroportin and transported to cells for metabolism
    - Enters cells via transferrin receptor
- Clinical symptoms
    - Anaemia
        - Fatigue, weakness
    - Pica and ice craving (compulsion to eat non-food substances)
    - Restless leg syndrome (correlated to reduced iron in CNS)
    - Signs
        - Cheiletis
        - Atrophic glossitis
        - Koilonychia (spoon nails)
        - Pallor
- Management of iron deficiency
    - General
        - Consider if severe or life-threatening anaemia
            - RBC transfusion often indicated
        - Monitor iron levels and response to treatment
        - Manage underlying causes of deficiency
    - Iron replacement therapy
        - Oral
            - Preferred as generally effective, available, cheap and safe
                - Not suitable for individuals with ongoing loss, IBD, CKD or intolerant to AEs
            - Absorption can be impaired with food intake or medications which reduce acid (PPIs, antacids)
                - Vitamin C may improve iron absorption
            - AEs
                - GI side effects (nausea, metallic taste, diarrhoea, vomiting, pain) are very common
        - IV
            - Use in severe iron deficiency or in conditions where oral iron is not suitable (e.g. malabsorption, intolerant)
                - LMW iron dextran, ferric carboxymaltose (similar efficacy, varies in cost)
                - HMW iron dextran no longer used due to allergic reactions
            - AEs
                - Risk of allergic reactions and anaphylaxis
                    - Decreased rates with modern formulations of IV iron
                - Risk of iron overload and secondary haemochromatosis
                    - Increased infection risk
