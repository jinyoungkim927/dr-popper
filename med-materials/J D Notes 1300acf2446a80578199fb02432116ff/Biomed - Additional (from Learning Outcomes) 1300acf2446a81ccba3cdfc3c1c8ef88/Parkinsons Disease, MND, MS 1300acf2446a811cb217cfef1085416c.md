# Parkinsons Disease, MND, MS

Parkinsons Disease

- DDx
    - Drug-induced (e.g. antipsychotics)
    - Neurodegenerative
        - Huntington’s disease (mood disturbances, dystonia)
        - MS
        - Alzheimers disease
        - DLB
    - Tremor
    - Neoplasm
- Describe circuitry of the basal ganglia
    - Movement is initiated in the motor cortex
        - Basal ganglia regulates cortical activity through loops with the thalamus
            - Thalamus is excitatory and pro-movement. The basal ganglia regulate the thalamus and prevent unnecessary movements
            - Achieved through GABA (inhibitory) and glutamate (excitatory)
        - At rest, GPi and GPe are active and exert inhibitory effects on the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus
    - Direct loop
        - Function
            - Facilitates movement
            - Activation of direct loop through putamen reinforces motor actions initiated at the cortical level
        - Feedback loop
            - Fibres from the cortex excite (glutamate) the GABAergic neurons of the striatum
                - GABAergic neurons inhibit the GPi (normally tonically active to inhibit thalamus)
                - Disinhibits thalamic neurons → excites cortical connections and facilitates movement

    - Indirect loop
        - Function
            - Suppresses unnecessary movement
            - Activation of indirect loop through putamen suppresses movement → provides negative feedback to cortex
        - Feedback loop
            - Fibres from the cortex excite the GABAergic cells of striatum
                - These neurons inhibit the GPe (which tonically inhibits the STN)
                - Disinhibition of STN results in excitation of GPi
                    - Excited GPi increases GABAergic inhibition of the thalamus → inhibition of excitatory neurons of thalamus to cortex
            - Results in negative feedback onto the cortex → suppression of unwanted or inappropriate movements at cortical level

    - Role of the substantia nigra
        - Provides extra adjustment on these feedback loops
            - Nigrostriatal pathway (dopaminergic) from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) modulates the direct and indirect pathways via dopamine
                - **Dopamine tends to favour the direct loop and facilitate more movement**
                - **Ensures fluidity of movement (no start-stop**)
        - Effect on direct loop
            - Dopamine acts on D1 receptors of GABAergic neurons of striatum
                - Releases GABA to GPi which inhibits it and reduces the inhibition on the thalamus
            - Net effect of increased movement
        - Effect on indirect loop
            - Dopamine acts on D2 receptors of GABAergic neurons on striatum
                - Reduces GABA on GPe and
            - Net effect of inhibiting the indirect pathway and producing more movement

- Clinical features of Parkinsons
    - Tremor
        - Early sign, often starts unilaterally
        - Resting tremor (”pill-rolling”) which often subsides with voluntary movements
            - Accentuated by distraction
            - May be characterised as a re-emergent postural tremor
    - Bradykinesia
        - Generalised slowness of movement with decreased amplitude and speed when moving
            - Described as weakness, incoordinated and tiredness
        - May notice gait freezing, shorter (shuffling) steps, festination, unsteadiness
        - Micrographia, hypomimia
    - Rigidity
        - Increased resistance to passive movement
            - Often unilateral + same side as tremor
        - Cogwheeling is often noticed (thought to be tremor superimposed on increased tone)
            - May be lead-pipe (tonic resistance smooth throughout ROM)
    - Postural instability
        - Impairment of centrally-mediated postural reflexes → imbalance and tendency to fall with a significant risk of injury
            - Often a late sign (if early, consider Parkinson-plus → multiple systems atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy)
            - Test with “pull/retropulsion” test
- Pathogenesis of Parkinsons Disease
    - Progressive dopaminergic neuron degeneration in substantia nigra of midbrain and locus ceruleus
        - Degeneration of nigrostriatal tract and decreased neuronal dopamine production
            - Results in facilitation of indirect pathway and increased inhibitory output from basal ganglia
                - **Reduced cortical motor activity and less movement**
    - Serotonin and noradrenaline depletion (in raphe nuclei)
        - Results in depressive symptoms
    - Acetylcholine surplus (likely cause of dyskinesia)
    - Pathological hallmarks
        - Lewy bodies (eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies within neural cells)
            - Made of a-synuclein and ubiquitin (and other proteins like neurofilament)
        - Loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNc (depigmentation)
        - Reactive gliosis in areas of degeneration
- Management
    - Non-pharmacological
        - Patient and family education
        - Allied health
            - Physiotherapy
            - Speech and language therapy
            - Occupational therapy
        - Support groups
    - Pharmacological
        - L-Dopa + peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor
            - e.g. Sinemet (L-dopa + carbidopa)
            - Mechanism
                - L-Dopa taken up by neural terminals and decarboxylated into dopamine
                    - Stored in nerves and increases DA neurotransmission
                - Peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor prevents conversion to dopamine prior to reaching the brain (DA cannot cross BBB)
            - AEs
                - Peak-dose dyskinesias (involuntary movements)
                - Fluctuations + wearing off
                - Hypotension
                - Fatigue and nausea
        - Metabolic inhibitors (adjuvant)
            - e.g. COMT inhibitors (entacapone)
            - Mechanism
                - No effect as monotherapy but prolongs action of co-administered L-dopa
                    - Provides more stable levels (minimise fluctuations and wearing-off)
        - Second-line
            - Direct acting DA agonists (e.g. pramipexole, bromocriptine)
                - Limited potency but associated with fewer dyskinesias
            - Anticholinergic/amantadine for tremor
    - Surgical
        - Deep brain stimulation
            - Recommended for patients with severe motor symptoms who respond to L-Dopa achieve insufficient control
- Why do you get wearing off in Parkinsons treatment
    - Potential reasons (wearing off = reduced efficacy to clinical treatment)
        - Loss of presynaptic terminals → less storage of DA (effect wears off sooner)
        - Post-synaptic changes

Motor Neuron Disease

- What are the different types of MND
    
    
    | Disease | Clinical features | Comments | Median survival |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | ALS | Multiple spinal segments affected with both UMN and LMN signs | Most common adult-onset form of MND | 3-5 years |
    | Primary lateral sclerosis | UMN signs only (may progress to ALS) |  |  |
    | Progressive muscular atrophy | LMN signs only |  |  |
    | Progressive bulbar palsy | Speech and swallowing initially affected due to LMN involvement of Cn IX, X, XII | Dysarthria, dysphonia, dysphagia. Risk of aspiration pneumonia | 2-3 years |
- What is ALS
    - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
        - Neurodegenerative disease of motor system
            - Characterised by degeneration in pyramidal neurons in motor cortex, cranial motor neurons, anterior horn cells of spinal cord
                - UMN and LMN dysfunction
            - Associated with TDP-43 protein inclusions within motor neurons
    - Characteristics
        - Both UMN and LMN signs
        - Constant disease progression (one arm or leg → contralateral side → eventual respiratory involvement)
            - Focal onset and typically asymmetric
        - Pattern of wasting
            - Cortical origin often shows ‘split hand’
                - Disproportionate wasting of first dorsal interossei and underside thenar muscles
                - Relative preservation of adductor digiti minimi
            - Limb-onset often shows prominent bilateral wasting of shoulder girdles, pectoral muscles and proximal upper arms
    - Management
        - Non-pharmacological
            - Nutritional supplementation
            - Gastrostomy tube placement as required
            - Non-invasive or assisted ventilation
            - MDT management
        - Pharmacological
            - Riluzole
                - Glutamate antagonist which decreases glutamate excitotoxicity in neurons
                    - Prolongs survival (around 3 months) if given early in disease course

- Multiple Sclerosis
    - Autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the nervous system
        - Characterised by distinct episodes of neurologic deficits, separated in time, attributable to white matter lesions that are separated in space
            - Demyelination and axonal degeneration in the brain and spinal cord
        - Complex aetiology (genetic and environmental factors)
            - Latitudinal distribution (countries at higher latitude have higher risk)
    - Pathophysiology
        - Autoimmune inflammation, degeneration and axonal degeneration
            - Immune reaction results in degeneration of Schwann cells → demyelination
                - Reversible however some attacks can result in axonal transection which is irreversible
                - Important to prevent inflammation
        - Activation of auto-reactive T-cells is the most commonly accepted theory
            - Inflammation → focal demyelination with partial preservation of axons (acute plaques)
                - Loss of axons and atrophy of oligodendrocytes (chronic plaques) → gliosis → inadequate remyelination
    - Disease course
        - Early MS → relapsing and remitting phenotype
            - Relapse
                - Acute episodes of neuroinflammation accompanied by inflammatory demyelination and axonal transection
                - Characterised by new or worsening neurological symptoms (objective signs, functional impairment)
            - Remitting (≥ 30 days of clinical stability and improvement)
        - Secondary progressive MS
            - Less inflammation but more neurodegeneration
        - Note: primary progressive MS is possible (no Hx of prior relapses)
    - Clinical features
        - Constitutional - fatigue, headache
        - Optic neuritis (common early manifestation)
            - Unilateral, painful, impaired vision
            - RAPD
        - Internuclear ophthalmoplegia
            - INO is a disorder of conjugate lateral gaze in which the affected eye shows impairment of adduction
            - Assume an affected right MLF and right eye
                - When gazing contralaterally (relative to the affected eye) [gazing left in this scenario], the affected eye adducts minimally (if at all)
                    - The contralateral eye abducts however with nystagmus
                    - The patient has horizontal diplopia due to the divergence of the eyes
            - Caused by injury or dysfunction in the medial longitudinal fasciculus
            - What is medial longitudinal fasciculus
                - MLF is a heavily myelinated tract which allows conjugate eye movement
                - MLF is responsible for extraocular eye movements including oculomotor reflex, saccadic eye movements and smooth pursuit, vestibulo-ocular reflex
                    - Connects the nuclei of CN3, 4, 6
                        - Via connecting the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF)-abducens nucleus complex of the contralateral side to the oculomotor nucleus of the ipsilateral side
                    - Integrates movements directed by the frontal eye fields (gaze centres) and information about head movement (CnVIII)
                    - Saccades are horizontal eye movements allowing for a change in fixation point
        - Uhthoff phenomenon (temperature intolerance)
            - Exacerbation in neurological symptoms due to increase in body temperature
        - Spinal cord tract demyelination
            - Sensory loss in limbs or one side of the face
            - Acute or subacute motor weakness
        - Cerebellar involvement
            - Gait disturbance and balance problems
            - Vertigo
    - Diagnosis
        - Clinical history (consistent symptoms with disease (optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, cerebellar)
            - Early onset seizures or aphasia are unlikely
        - MRI
            - Attack + MRI evidence of other subclinical events (dissemination in space and time)
            - White matter hyperintensities (T2) or white matter lesions; classically periventricular
        - CSF analysis
            - Presence of oligoclonal bands (IgG production in CSF)
        - How do you diagnose MS?
            - A clinical diagnosis. The McDonald criteria (2017) applies primarily to patients who have a typical clinically isolated syndrome which suggests the onset of relapsing-remitting MS
                - Can also be applied to patients presenting with insidious neurological progression suggestive of primary progressive MS
            
            |  | Number of lesions with objective clinical evidence | Additional data need for a diagnosis of MS |
            | --- | --- | --- |
            | 2 or more clinical attacks | 2 or more | None |
            |  | 1 (as well as historical evidence of a previous attack involving a lesion in a distinct anatomical location) | None |
            |  | 1 | Dissemination in space demonstrated by an additional clinical attack implicating a different CNS site or by MRI |
            | 1 clinical attack | 2 or more | Dissemination in time demonstrated by an additional clinical attack or by MRI **OR** demonstration of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands |
            |  | 1 | Dissemination in space demonstrated by an additional clinical attack implicating a different CNS site or by MRI   **AND**                                Dissemination in time demonstrated by an additional clinical attack or by MRI **OR** demonstration of CSF specific oligoclonal bands |
            - An attack is defined as a monophasic clinical episode with patient-reported symptoms and objective findings typical of MS
                - Reflects a focal or multifocal inflammatory demyelinating event in the CNS, developing acutely or subacutely, with a duration of at least 24h, with or without recovery, absence of fever or infection
            - If MS is suspected due to a clinically isolated syndrome, but the McDonald criteria are not completely met, the diagnosis is possible MS
            - Presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF reflects IgG production
    - Management
        - Disease-modifying drugs (long-term use)
            - Monoclonal antibodies (most efficacious, have risks)
                - Anti-CD20 B cell (ocrelizumab, rituximab)
                    - Use ocrelizumab first-line in PPMS
                - Anti-integrin (natalizumab) - prevents leukocyte transmigration
                - Anti CD52 T cell, B cell, NK cells, monocytes (alemtuzumab)
            - Oral therapies
                - Fumarates (dimethyl fumarate)
                - Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (fingolimod, siponimod)
                - Teriflunomide
                    - Active metabolite of leflunomide which inhibits pyrimidine biosynthesis and disrupts T cell interaction with APCs
                - Cladribine
                    - Purine antimetabolite which targets lymphocyte subtypes
            - Platform injection therapies (first approved DMTs for MS - safest)
                - Interferons (Betaseron)
                - Glatiramer acetate
        - Acute attacks
            - Treat with high dose IV methylpredisone (1g, 3-5 days)
            - High dose oral steroids + PPI (1250mg prednisolone)
- Acute transverse myelitis
    - Spinal inflammation extending horizontally throughout the cross-section of the spinal cord
    - Defined by:
        - Motor, sensory or autonomic dysfunction attributable to the spinal cord
        - Signs and symptoms on both sides of the body (not necessarily symmetrical)
        - Clearly defined sensory level
