# Secretory and non-secretory diarrhoea (cholera + salmonella)

- Approach to diarrhoea (5-step approach)
    - Rule out mimics (faecal incontinence, impaction and overflow)
    - Rule out medications as a cause (e.g. antacids, nutritional supplements, antibiotics)
    - Distinguish acute diarrhoea (≤ 2 weeks) and chronic diarrhoea (≥ 4 weeks)
    - Categorise as inflammatory, fatty or watery (via stool test)
        - Inflammatory (frequent, small-volume, bloody)
            - Leukocytes or faecal calprotectin in stool
            - Raised CRP or ESR
        - Fatty stools (greasy, bulky stools which are difficult to flush)
            - Floating stools indicates increase gas production by bacteria
            - Due to malabsorption or maldigestion
                - Sudan stain for screening
                - Timed stool collection (100g fat diet and ≥ 7g of fat in 24h is diagnostic)
        - Watery
            - Osmotic
                - Ingestion of poorly absorbed ions or sugars
                - Stool volume decreased with fasting
            - Secretory
                - Disruption of epithelial electrolyte transport
                - Stool volume maintained with fasting
- Cholera
    - Caused by Vibrio cholerae
        - Comma-shaped, Gram-negaitve bacteria
        - Transmitted primarily through contaminated drinking water but may also be present in food
    - Pathogenesis
        - Non-invasive and remain within the intestinal lumen
        - Virulence factors
            - Flagella (motility and attachment)
                - Allow efficient bacterial colonisation
            - Secreted metalloproteinase
                - Haemagluttinin activity which aids bacterial detachment and stool shedding
            - Preformed enterotoxin (cholera toxcin)
                - Endocytosed and delivered to endoplasmic reticulum in the cell
                    - Stimulates adenylate cyclase and increased cAMP
                        - Opens CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)
                    - Releases chloride ions into the lumen
                        - Also decreases Na and HCO3 absorption
                - Results in osmotic gradient and massive secretory diarrhoea
    - Clinical features
        - Most people are asymptomatic and suffer mild diarrhoea
        - Severe disease = abrupt onset of watery diarrhoea and vomiting
            - Can lead to dehydration, hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, shock and death
    - Diagnosis
        - Clinical suspicion
        - Isolation or identification by stool MCS
            - Selective thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts agar
    - Fluid replacement is critical
- Salmonella
    - Members of Enterobacteriaceae family of Gram-negative bacilli
        - Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever)
        - Non-typhoid Salmonella spp → gastroenteritis
            - Transmission through contaminated food (raw or undercooked meat, poultry, egg, milk)
            - Most common in elderly people and children
    - Pathogenesis
        - Few viable organisms necessary to cause infection
        - Virulence factors
            - Genes encode a type III secretion system able to transfer bacterial proteins into M cells (special epithelial cells which overlie gastric lymphoid follicles) and enterocytes
                - Activate host cell mechanisms and bacterial uptake into phagosomes where they can multiply
            - Secrete a molecule which attracts neutrophils into the lumen and potentiates mucosal damage
    - Stool culture essential for diagnosis
    - Typhoid fever
        - Caused by Salmonella typhi (endemic) and S. paratyphi (travellers)
            - Transmission from person to person or via contaminated food and water
        - Disease course
            - Acute infection
                - Anorexia, abdominal pain
                - Bloating, nausea and vomiting
                - Bloody diarrhoea
            - Followed by short asymptomatic phase
                - Bacteraemia and fever with flu-like symptoms
                    - Blood cultures may prompt antibiotic treatment
                    - Otherwise, febrile period associated with abdominal tenderness which may mimic appendicitis
                        - Rose spots may be seen in chest and abdomen
                        - Can lead to encephalopathy, seizures, endocarditis, cholecystitis
        - Pathogenesis
            - Bacteria taken up by M cells and engulfed by macrophages within lymphoid tissue
                - Infection results in Peyer patches enlarging into plateau-like elevations
                - Mucosal shedding creates oval ulcers along the long axis of the ileum (blood diarrhoea)
            - S. typhi and paratyphi can disseminate via lymph and blood to cause reactive hyperplasia of draining LNs
                - Splenomegaly and typhoid nodules (scattered foci of parenchymal necrosis)
- Pseudomembranous colitis
    - Generally caused by C. difficile and associated with antibiotics
    - Results in formation of pseudomembranes
        - Made of an adherent layer of inflammatory cells and debris at sites of colonic mucosal injury
            - Denuded surface epithelium
            - Superficial lamina propria contains a dense neutrophil infiltrate and occasional fibrin thrombi within capillaries
