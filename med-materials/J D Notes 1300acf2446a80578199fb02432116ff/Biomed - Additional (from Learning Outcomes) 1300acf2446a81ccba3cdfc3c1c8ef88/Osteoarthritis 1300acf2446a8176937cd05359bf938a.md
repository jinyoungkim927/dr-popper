# Osteoarthritis

- Definition
    - Degenerative joint disease characterised by degeneration of the articular cartilage
        - Categorised into primary OA (absence of predisposing trauma or disease) or secondary OA (pre-existing joint abnormality)
        - Oligoarthritis often affecting hands, knees, hips and spine
    - Clinical features
        - Deep and aching pain exacerbated by use
        - Morning stiffness (≤ 30 mins)
        - Crepitus (grating or popping sensation within the joint)
        - Limitation in range of movement
    - Risk factors
        - Non-modifiable
            - Older age
            - Female
            - Muscle weakness
            - Existing conditions (inflammatory arthritis, congenital joint disorders, connective tissue disorders
        - Modifiable
            - Obesity
            - Repetitive joint trauma (occupation, sports activities)
- Pathophysiology
    - A disease of the entire joint caused by a complex interplay of risk factors, mechanical stress and abnormal joint mechanics
        - Results in pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases which mediate joint destruction
        - Articular cartilage bears the brunt of the degenerative changes
            - Surface fibrillation, irregularity and focal erosions
                - Erosions eventually extend to the bone and continually expands to involve more of the joint surface
    - Molecular pathogenesis
        - Chondrocytes are critical to maintain cartilage elasticity, synthesis and repair the extracellular matrix
            - Imbalance of cellular signals (genetic and acquired) results in overall degradation and loss of matrix
                - Degenerating cartilage contains more water and less proteoglycan (less turgor and elasticity)
                - Loss of collagen network (results in chondrocyte apoptosis)
        - Reactive chondrocytes under hyperplasia and proliferate to attempt to repair the damage by synthesising new collagen and proteoglycans
            - New cartilage growths ossify to form osteophytes
            - Improperly mineralised collagen results in subchondral bone thickening
- Morphology of OA
    - Early changes
        - Fibrillation and cracking of the articular cartilage surface
        - Chondromalacia (soft, granular articular surface)
    - Late changes
        - Bone eburnation
            - Exposure of the subchondral bone plate due to cartilage loss
            - Bone becomes smoothened and burnished by friction
        - Subchondral cysts
            - Synovial fluid collects in fracture gaps within the bone
        - Osteophytes
            - Develop at the margins of the articular surface

- Investigative approach to OA
    - A clinical diagnosis:
        - Persistent usage-related joint pain in one or few joints
        - Age ≥ 45
        - Morning stiffness ≤ 30 minutes
    - Principal diagnostics - identifying structural and radiologic changes is important
        - **X-ray (AP and lateral) of affected joints**
            - Assess severity of structural change although poor correlation between structural change and pain
            - **Characteristic signs of OA - LOSS:**
                - Loss of joint space.
                - Osteophytes.
                - Subchondral cysts.
                - Subchondral sclerosis.

    - **Consider additional investigations to rule out differentials**
        - **Laboratory studies:**
            - FBC/CRP/ESR
                - Rule out inflammatory pathologies (normal in OA)
            - RF and anti-CCP (DDx: RA)
        - **Special tests:**
            - Consider synovial fluid aspirate if suspicious of septic arthritis, gout, pseudogout
- Management
    - The management of patients with osteoarthritis can be s**upportive ± definitive if indicated.**
    - **Supportive management:**
        - **Patient education** - contributing factors, prognosis, treatment.
        - **Lifestyle modifications:**
            - Weight loss - aim for at least 10%. (BMI <27)
                - Regular exercise with minimal load - e.g. swimming and cycling.
            - Exercise physiology for increased supporting muscle strength (quads, hamstrungs).
            - Topical and heat/cold therapy.
            - Use of walking aids (e.g. walking stick) or braces.
        - **Pharmacological managament:**
            - **Simple analgesia:**
                - Topical NSAID (i.e. Voltaren) - if one or a few joints affected.
                - Oral NSAID - if inadequate symptom relief or multiple joints.
                    - GI, Renal and potential for HTN development.
                        - Nurofen (lowest known of GI bleeds), naproxin (lowest cardiovascular side effects)
            - **Adjunctive therapy:**
                - ± duloxetine (SNRI) - for persistant OA.
                - ± Amitriptyline
                - ± topical capsaicin (consider before moving to systemic NSAIDs).
            - **Intra-articular pharmacology -** controversial:
                - Glucocorticoid injections - may provide relief for 4-12 weeks.
                - Hyaluronic acid injections.
    - **Definitive management:**
        - **Surgical therapy -** in patients with chronic pain non-responsive to first-line management:
            - **Arthroplasty:**
                - Unicondylar knee replacement - isolated compartment pathology.
                - Bicondylar knee replacement.
                - Patellofemoral joint replacement.
            - **Corrective osteotomy -** younger patients with correctable joint malformations - e.g. varus/valgus deformity.
            - **Arthrodesis -** rare for hip and knee but used in case of failure of endoprosthesis or in select OA subtypes e.g. Hebedern;s OA.
    - **Regular follow up, ideally every 3 months regarding effects of treatment.**

- OA of spine
    - Clinical features
        - Osteophyte impingement can cause:
            - Nerve root compression with radicular pain
            - Muscle spasms and atrophy
            - Neurologic deficits
    - Pathophysiology
        - Declining functional integrity of the spine which predisposes patients to degenerative changes due to alterations in load bearing forces
            - Begins with age-related intervertebral disc degeneration
        - In a healthy spine, the facet joints carry around 1/3 of the load
            - With facet joint and intervertebral disc degeneration, the load bearing increases to 70%
                - Subchondral bone density increases along the osteophyte formation
                - Can result in spinal stenosis
            - Overall features of cartilage necrosis, ulceration, fibrillation, instability
        - Advanced vertebral arthritis due to loss of synovial fluid within the joint and influx of inflammatory cells and cytokines
            - Sensitises pain receptors within the joint → chronic pain
