    - The head of the humerus has slipped medially and inferiorly to lie in a subcoracoid position. This may occur when the arm is forcefully abducted
    - When the head of the humerus slips off the glenoid fossa, the head is drawn medially by the powerful adductors of the shoulder
    - On examination, the greater tubercle of the humerus is no longer the most lateral bony projection of the shoulder. Instead the acromion is the most lateral point.
- Elbow Dislocation

- Monteggia Fracture
    - Fracture of the proximal 1/3 of the ulna with dislocation of the head of the radius
        - Most commonly caused by a fall on an outstretched hand with the forearm in excessive pronation
    - Complications
        - Wrist drop
        - Malunion
        - Compartment syndrome
        - Paralysis of FPL
            - Fracture site is near the origin of the anterior interosseous nerve from the main trunk of the median nerve
            - May lead to FLP and FDP paralysis of index finger

- Gallezia Fracture?
- Spiral fracture of metacarpal most commonly from force on a clenched fist (transmitted along shaft)

Lower Limb

- Femoral fractures
    - Fractures which interrupt the blood supply to the femoral head are more likely to cause avascular necrosis. Increased likelihood the closer to the head of the femur (i.e. subcapital)
        - Due to interruption of the reticular blood supply to the head of femur (with some contribution by ligamentum teres artery of femur
        
        Note: adductor tubercle exists on posteromedial aspect of femur

- Patellar dislocation
    - Mechanisms that reduce the risk of lateral dislocation of the patella
        - Medially oriented fibres of lower vastus medialis
        - High patellar articular surface of the lateral epicondyle of femur
- Tibial fracture
