# Additional: Psychiatric Emergencies

Serotonin syndrome

- Cause
    - Any drug which increases 5-HT
        - Antidepressants (SNRIs, MAOIs, TCAs)
        - Other medications (opioids - tramadol, fentanyl), ondansetron, triptans
        - Illicit drugs (amphetamines, cocaine)
        - OTC - St John’s wort
- Clinical manifestations (3A’s)
    - Activity increase (neuromuscular)
        - Tremor, hypertonia, **clonus, hyperreflexia**, seizure
    - Autonomic instability
        - Hyperthermia, diaphoresis
        - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea
    - Altered mental status
- DDx
    - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (rigidity > hyperreflexia)
    - Anticholinergic toxicity, sympathomimetic agent toxicity
    - Thyroid storm, sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis
    - Mania, delirium
- Management
    - Discontinue serotonergic agent
    - Supportive
        - Stabilise vital signs
            - Antihypertensives (short acting if needed - esmolol, nitroprusside)
            - Supplemental O2 as needed
            - Continuous cardiac monitoring
        - IV fluids
        - Cooling packs (over axilla, groin)
        - May need sedation (diazepam) or muscle relaxants
    - Definitive: cyproheptadine (5HT2 receptor antagonist)

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

- Cause
    - Excess antipsychotic use (typical > atypical) + genetic predisposition (due to dopamine blockade)
- Manifestation
    - **Altered mental state and delirium** + M FEVER
        - Myoglobinuria
        - **Fever**
        - Encephalopathy
        - Vitals (unstable) - labile BP **(autonomic instability)**
        - Enzymes (raised CK) [rhabdomyolysis]
        - **Rigidity** (lead pipe)
- Treatment
    - Discontinue antipsychotics
    - Supportive therapy
        - Aggressive hydration (esp. if elevated CK)
        - Cooling for hyperthermia
    - Pharmacological management
        - Dopamine agonist (e.g. bromocriptine)
        - Dantrolene (decrease intracellular Ca levels, muscle relaxant)
            - Ryanodine receptor antagonist - inhibits Ca release from SR
    - Benzodiazepines (acute)

TCA overdose

- Cause
    - Excess exogenous administration of TCA
- Clinical manifestation
    - Often related to anti-cholinergic activity
        - Respiratory depression
        - ‘Tricyclic - 3 C’s’: convulsions, coma, cardiotoxicity (arrhythmias)
        - Hyperthermia
- Management
    - Supportive treatment
        - Continuous vital monitoring - ECG
        - NaHCO3 (stabilise membrane and prevent arrhythmia
    - Activated charcoal (decrease toxin gut absorption)

Lithium toxicity

- Cause
    - Lithium has a highly narrow therapeutic range
        - Toxicity occurs at serum levels > 1.5mmol
        - Can be contributed by:
            - High lithium dose
            - Decreased renal excretion (AKI)
            - Increased renal absorption (drug-drug interactions, thiazides, NSAIDs, ACEi)
            - Low effective circulating volume
- Manifestation
    - Acute
        - GI: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea
        - Neuromuscular
            - Delirium, psychomotor impairment, somnolence, coma
            - Coarse tremors, myoclonus, seizures
            - Cerebellar signs: ataxia, slurred speech, nystagmus
    - Chronic
        - Thyroid dysregulation
        - Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
    - Teratogenic
        - Ebstein anomaly (caudal displacement of tricuspid valve)
            - Large atria, small ventricle and regurgitation
    - LiTHIUM
        - Low thyroid (hypothyroidism)
        - Heart (Ebstein anomaly)
        - Insipidus (nephrogenic DI)
        - Unwanted Movements
- Treatment
    - Aggressive hydration with NaCl +/- dialysis

Delirium tremens

- Cause
    - Alcohol withdrawal - classically in inpatient setting
        - Appears 24-48h after cessation
- Manifestation
    - Anxiety
    - Psychomotor agitation
    - Insomnia
    - Hallucinations
    - Tremors
    - Seizures
- Treatment
    - Thiamine IV
    - Intermediate or long-acting benzodiazepines (diazepam)
        - Guided by symptoms (CIWA score ≥ 8) or fixed schedule
