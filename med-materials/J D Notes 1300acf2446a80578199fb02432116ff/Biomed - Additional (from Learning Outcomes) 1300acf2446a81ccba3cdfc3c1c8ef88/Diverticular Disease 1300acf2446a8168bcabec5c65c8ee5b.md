# Diverticular Disease

- Refers to acquired pseudo-diverticular outpouchings of the colonic mucosa and submucosa
    - Most common in the sigmoid colon
- Pathogenesis
    - Develop under conditions of elevated intraluminal pressure
        - Facilitated by unique structure of the colonic muscularis propria
            - Nerves, arterial vasa recta and connective tissue sheaths penetrate the inner circular muscle and create discontinuities in the muscle wall
                - In other parts of the intestine, these gaps are reinforced by the external longitudinal layer however, in the colon, this muscle layer is discontinuous
                    - Aggregates into three bands (taenia coli) which converge on the appendix and rectum
    - High luminal pressures may be generated by exaggerated peristalsis contractions
        - Spasmodic sequestration of bowel segments → exacerbated by low fibre diets which reduce stool bulk
        - **Muscle hypertrophy** + segmentation (high pressure and increased intraluminal pressure in the contracting segment)
            - Increased pressure on bowel wall and outpouching
            - Hypertrophy causes symptoms (cramps and constipation) —> gradual onset
- Risk factors
    - Older age
    - Western diet
        - Low fibre, high meat
            - Due to hard stools + constant straining
        - Asian population have a higher tendency to present in the right side (likely genetic)
- Morphology
    - Small, flask-like outpouchings (0.5-1cm) which occur in a regular distribution between the taenia coli
        - Most common in the sigmoid colon
        - Thin wall composed of flattened or atrophic mucosa, compressed submucosa and attenuated muscularis propria
    - Hypertrophy of circular layer of muscularis propria is common
    - Obstruction of diverticula leads to inflammatory changes
        - Diverticulitis and peridiverticulits
        - Risk of perforation as the diverticula wall is supported only by muscularis mucosa and thin subserosal adipose tissue
            - Can result in pericolonic abscesses, sinus tract and fistula formation, and rarely, peritonitis
    - Recurrent diverticulitis can cause segmental colitis, fibrotic thickening or stricture formation
- Complications
    - Diverticular bleeding
        - Usually a large and painless bleed due to vasa recta forming in the diverticula
            - DDx: angiodysplasia
        - Management
            - Resuscitate
                - Fluid resuscitation followed by replacement of blood products
            - Stop bleeding: colonoscopy (clip) or IR (angiogram and embolisation)
    - Diverticulitis
        - Abdominal pain, often LIF (parietal) —> localised sign
            - Sigmoid can rarely present RIF
            - Exclude UTI with these presenting symptoms
        - Microperforations results in a peritonitic response
        - Investigation
            - CT abdomen to confirm (diverticulosis, fat stranding)
                - FBC to look for leukocytosis
                - Avoid oral contrast and colonoscopy urgently
                    - Risk of rupture (due to increased pressure)
            - Keep patient NBM, IV fluid hydration
            - Antibiotics: ampicillin, metronidazole, gentamicin
                - Augmentin for PO afterwards
                - Anaerobes: bacteroides
    - Stricture (LBO)
        - Occurs in chronic, recurrent attacks of diverticulitis
    - Perforation and diverticular abscess formation
        - Symptoms and signs
            - Same as diverticulitis
            - Swinging fever (intermittent bacteraemia from abscess leakage - despite walled off abscess)
        - Investigation: CT abdomen or U/S to confirm
        - Management (abscess)
            - Small size - antibiotics
            - Larger - drainage (needle aspirate, drain) [5cm diameter]
                - U/S or CT guided
                - Surgical
        - If perforated
            - Generalised peritonitis (diffuse pain, shoulder tip (diaphragm irritation)
            - Investigation
                - Surgical emergency (need imaging to confirm)
                    - Hartmann’s (resection of bowel and stoma formation)
                        - Reverse with a minimum of 6 weeks (allows process of healing)
                    - Wash out of the peritoneal cavity (improves recovery outcomes)
                - CXR for pneumoperitoneum
                    - CT abdomen to confirm if it cannot be seen on CXR
    - Fistula formation
        - Types
            - Colo-vesical
                - More common in males
                - Sx: faeculent, foul-smelling urine, pneumaturia (air in urine), recurrent UTIs
            - Colo-cutaneous
                - Commonly when you drain abscesses
            - Colo-vaginal
                - Often in hysterectomy patients
                - Cancer can be the cause
            - Colo-enteric
                - Sx: gastroenteritis (colonic bacteria) leading to diarrhoea
            - Rarer: colo-uterine or colo-ureteric
    - Operate by removing sigmoid colon
        - Distal border - rectum
        - Proximal border where the bowel is soft (due to hypertrophy muscle border)
            - Difficult operation due to scarring, loss of normal architecture
    - Indications for surgery
        - Recurrent diverticulitis attacks (frequency, severity)
        - Patient choice
        - Comorbidities
        - Age (younger > older)
        - Immunosuppressed/immunocompromised (greater risk of harm from future infection)

Note: femoral angiogram

- Positive if extravasation identified (of contrast) which detects bleeds > 0.5mL/min. Amenable to intervention
