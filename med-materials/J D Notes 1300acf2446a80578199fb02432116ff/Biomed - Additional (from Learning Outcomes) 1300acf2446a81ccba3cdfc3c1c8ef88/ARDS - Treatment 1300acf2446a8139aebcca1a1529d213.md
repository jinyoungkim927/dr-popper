# ARDS - Treatment

Goals

- Fluid management
    - Optimise oxygenation and haemodynamic support
    - Patients are at risk of APO due to increased vascular permeability (conservative management preferred if hypotension can be avoided)
- Additional therapies if hypoxaemic despite standard card
    - Glucocorticoids
    - Neuromuscular blockers
        - In refractory severe hypoxaemia
    - Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (e.g. NO)
- Supportive care to avoid complications
    - Sedation (light)
    - Nutritional support to offset catabolic losses
    - Prophylaxis for VTE, stress ulcers, pneumonia
