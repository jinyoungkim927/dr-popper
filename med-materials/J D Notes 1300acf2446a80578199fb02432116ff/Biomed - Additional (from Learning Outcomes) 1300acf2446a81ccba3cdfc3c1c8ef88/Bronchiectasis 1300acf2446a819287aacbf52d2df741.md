# Bronchiectasis

- Definition
    - Chronic lung disease characterised by:
        - Permanent dilation of bronchi and bronchioles due to destruction of muscle and supporting elastic tissue
        - Secondary to persistent, necrotising infections (impaired mucociliary clearance)
    - Clinical manifestations
        - **Cough**
            - **Often productive and copious purulent sputum**
        - Dyspnoea and intermittent wheezing
        - Haemoptysis
        - Pleuritic chest pain (due to chronic cough)
        - **History of recurrent pulmonary infections which require antibiotics**
- Causes
    - Most common cause is thought to be an antecedent respiratory infection (often in childhood)
        - Bacteria
            - MTB or M avium complex
            - H. influenzae
            - Pseudomonas aeruginosa
            - S. aureus
        - Viral
            - RSV
    - Obstructive (localised to a lung segment)
        - Tumours
        - Foreign bodies
    - Congenital
        - Cystic fibrosis (diffuse)
        - Primary ciliary dyskinesia
            - AR condition associated with bronchiectasis and sterility in males (impaired cilia function)
    - Inflammation
        - Chronic aspiration or GORD
        - Inhalation injury
    - Pulmonary
        - Asthma
        - COPD
        - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
- Pathology
    - Three key pathogenetic mechanisms
        - Recurrent infections
        - Airway obstruction
        - Peribronchial fibrosis
    - Macrosopic
        - Often affects lower lobes bilaterally (unless localised segment in tumor or aspiration)
            - Airways dilated often to periphery
        - In acute cases, may have intense acute and chronic inflammatory exudate within walls of bronchi and bronchioles
        - Bronchial or bronchial necrosis can result in an abscess cavity → fungal ball
    - Histological changes
        - Cartilage destruction and fibrosis
        - Mucosal and mucous gland hyperplasia
            - Increased mucous and exudate
        - Inflammatory cell infiltration
            - Neutrophil predominant
- Investigations
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - CXR
            - Thickened and abnormally dilated bronchial walls
                - Tram-track opacities
                - Ring shadows
                - Parallel linear densitiies
            - Complications
                - Patchy densities (mucoid impaction and consolidation)
        - High-resolution CT chest is more sensitive and specific
            - Bronchial dilation is cardinal
                - Lack of bronchial tapering (does not decrease in calibre towards periphery)
                - Broncho-arterial ratio > 1
            - Tram-track sign (dilated airways)
            - Signet ring (dilated airway adjacent to pulmonary artery branch)
    - Ancillary
        - Bedside
            - ABG
            - Consider lung function testing (FEV1 decreased and air trapping (raised FVC))
        - Labs
            - Sputum MCS
            - FBC, UEC, LFT
            - Consider CF testing (sweat test or genetic test) for patients ≤ 40
- Management
    - Identify and treat the underlying cause
    - Non-pharmacological
        - Chest physiotherapy to promote mucus clearance
        - Smoking cessation
        - Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal
    - Pharmacological
        - Infection control
            - Antibiotics for acute exacerbation
                - Empirical: amoxicillin + doxycycline
            - Consider long-term if indicated
        - In obstruction
