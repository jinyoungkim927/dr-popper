# Gestational trophoblastic disease

**Case:** *A woman presents to your clinic after missing her last menstrual period and subsequently taking a pregnancy test, which was positive 3 months ago. Over the last few days, she developed pelvic discomfort, small amounts of per vaginal bleeding, hyperemesis gravidarum and a distended uterus. On testing, her ß-HCG was double the normal range for a normal pregnancy. Ultrasound was performed and no foetal heart sounds or parts were identified.*

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: gestational trophoblastic disease given:
        - B-hCG is higher than a normal pregnancy
        - No identifiable foetal parts
        - Hyperemesis
        - PV bleeding and distended uterus
    - Likely to be a molar pregnancy (complete) given severe and symptomatic presentations
    - DDx
        - Ectopic pregnancy
        - Spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
            - Pregnancy loss < 20 weeks GA or foetus < 400g (if gestation unknown)
        - Invasive mole or choriocarcinoma (malignant GTD)
        - Pelvic tumour
            - Cervical, ovarian or endometrial Ca
- Principal investigative approach to GTD
    - Serial B-hCG
        - Useful to confirm elevated levels and monitor treatment
            - Levels should normalise rapidly after management
        - **Diagnostic if > 100 000 milli-IU/mL (mIU/mL)**
            - More elevated in complete molar pregnancy and choriocarcinoma
    - Transabdominal and transvaginal US (examine uterus and identify presence of pregnancy or trophoblastic disease)
        - **If findings are equivocal for a normal pregnancy, and B-hCG is not diagnostic (common in partial mole), repeat weekly until sure**
        - Findings
            - Normal
                - Gestational sac (5 weeks)
                - Yolk sac (6 weeks)

            - Complete
                - No foetal parts and lack of heart tones
                - Echogenic mass interspersed with many hypoechogenic cystic spaces

                - No amniotic fluid
            - Partial
                - Foetal parts may be visualised and some heart tones detectable
