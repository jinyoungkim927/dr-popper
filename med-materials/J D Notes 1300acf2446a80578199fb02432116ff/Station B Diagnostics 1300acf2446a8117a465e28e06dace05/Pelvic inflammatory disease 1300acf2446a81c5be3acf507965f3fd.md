# Pelvic inflammatory disease

***Case:** A 35yo female with hx of prior chlamydial infection presents with low-grade fever, vaginal
discharge, lower abdominal pain, cervical motion tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding. On
abdominal examination there is lower abdominal tenderness on deep palpation. On pelvic exam,
there is cervical motion tenderness and a mucopurulent vaginal discharge.*

- Investigative approach to PID
    - **Diagnosis**
        - Clinical diagnosis (empirical antibiotics should not be delayed) which can be supported by investigations
            - Sexually active women with lower abdominal pain demonstrating examination findings:
                - Tenderness (cervical motion, uterine, adnexal)
                - Purulent or bloody PV discharge
        - **Cause may not be specifically identified in up to 70% of cases**
    - Gold standard, for treatment-resistant complicated cases in laparoscopy
        - Identifies tubal erythema, oedema, adhesions, purulent exudate
    - Ancillary
        - Bedside
            - Urine and swabs
                - **First-catch urine and endocervical swab (STIs)**
