# Whooping Cough

## Past question: **whooping cough** (diagnostics)

**Case:** *A 9-month old child presents with persistent cough resulting in vomiting. Her mother says she has been feeding poorly, been irritable and not been able to be settled. On examination, you hear an inspiratory ‘whoop’.*

- Differential diagnosis for URTI in childhood
    - Infections
        - Pertussis (persistent cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory ‘whoop’)
        - Bronchiolitis (RSV)
        - Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis - parainfluenza)
        - Other: adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMP)
    - Inhaled foreign body
    - Anaphylaxis
    - Asthma exacerbation (if older child)
- What is pertussis
    - An infectious disease of the respiratory tract caused by Bordatella pertussis
    - Presumptive diagnostic features
        - Cough lasting > 2 weeks
        - At least one of the following
            - Coughing paroxysms
            - Inspiratory whoop
            - Post-tussive vomiting
            - Apnoea (infants)
- Investigative approach for pertussis
    - Principal diagnostic investigation
        - Nasopharyngeal swab or aspiration
            - PCR: increased sensitivity to culture, quicker results
            - MCS: 100% specificity however growth takes 7-10 days
        - Note: if positive PCR and no cough → not pertussis (clinical Dx first)
        - IgA serology may be more useful in later stage of disease diagnosis (2-8 weeks of cough onset)
            - Poor sensitivity
    - Other:
        - Bedside
            - O2 saturations, continuous monitoring
        - Labs
            - FBC
                - Lymphocytosis (extent correlates to prognosis)
            - UEC and CMP
                - Electrolyte abnormalities due to decreased oral intake and/or persistent vomiting
            - CRP - elevated
            - BSL
        - Imaging
            - CXR (rule out DDx)
- Causative organism in pertussis
    - Bordatella pertussis
        - Gram-negative obligate aerobic coccobacillus
        - High virulence (around 50% of infants require hospitalisation)
        - Incubation period: 7-10 days (range 4-21)
        - Duration of illness
            - Without antibiotics: 4-6 weeks
            - With antibiotics: around 5 days
        - Immunity
            - Neither vaccination nor actual infection confers complete or lifelong immunity
        - Virulence factors
            - Multiple adhesion molecules
                - Filamentous haemagglutinin
                - Pertactic
                - Fimbriae
                - Tracheal colonising factor
            - Toxins
                - Cause inflammation of the airway (tracheal cytotoxin, pertussis toxin)
                - Pertussis toxin mainly responsible for the systemic manifestations (e.g. hypoglycaemia secondary to hyperinsulinaemia)
            - Factors which interfere with phagocytic function
                - Pertussis toxin
                    - Inhibits G-protein coupling which regulates cAMP production in phagocytes
                        - Disturb cellular signalling mechanisms
- Pathogenesis of pertussis
    - Transmission
        - Airborne respiratory droplets
        - Vaccine preventable
        - Patients are infectious just prior to and within 21 days of the onset of cough
    - Pathogenesis
        - Production of virulence factors promote cellular attachment
            - Cause local tissue damage and systemic manifestations
            - Interfere with host mechanisms
        - Adherence to ciliated respiratory epithelium
            - Via virulence factors
                - Adhesins (mediate binding to cilia)
                - Tracheal cytotoxin (stop cilia from functioning, prevents clearance)
                - Pertussis toxin (disables Gi, decreased cAMP production, disturbs phagocyte signalling and activation)
                    - Causes lymphocytosis
            - Local inflammation and paralysis of ciliated structures
                - Microaspirations → cough and/or pneumonia and/or cyanosis
- Clinical course of pertussis
    - Three stages characterised by different clinical pictures
        - Catarrhal (1-2 weeks)
            - Non-specific URTI symptoms
                - Mild cough, watery nasal discharge, rarely low-grade fever
                - Conjunctivitis (sometimes)
        - Paroxysmal (2-6 weeks)
            - Intense coughing paroxysms
                - Followed by deep inspiration (’whoop’) - may not occur in older children or adults
            - Post-tussive emesis
            - May cause bleeding of conjunctiva, venous congestion and petechiae (intensity of cough)
        - Convalescent stage (weeks to months)
            - Gradual resolution
                - Cough may persist but will not experience the same paroxysms
- Complications of pertussis
    - Infection
        - Primary (bordatella) or secondary pneumonia
        - Otitis media
    - Respiratory
        - Haemoptysis
        - Pneumothorax
        - Rib fractures
    - Other
        - Seizures (hypoxic)
        - Encephalopathy due to apnoea +/- toxins (20% mortality)
    - Death
        - Unlikely in infants > 3 months
- Approach to management in pertussis
    - Supportive treatment
        - Fluids and nutrition
            - IV fluid replacement, NG tube for feeding if needed
            - Manage poor oral intake and increased energy expenditure with paroxysms of coughing
        - Supplemental O2
        - Monitoring
            - RR, SpO2, HR
            - WBC daily (leukocytosis)
        - Anti-tussives or sedatives
    - Definitive management (antibiotics)
        - Consider antibiotics if:
            - Diagnosed in catarrhal or early paroxysmal phase (may reduce severity)
            - Cough for less than 14 days (may reduce spread; reduces school exclusion period)
            - Admitted to hospital
            - Complications (pneumonia, cyanosis, apnoea)
        - **Macrolides are first-line**
            - Double dose on day 1
            - If able to tolerate tablets: azithromycin (10mg/kg PO, 5 days)
            - If unable to tolerate tablets: clarithromycin oral BD, 7 days
        - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is second line (age > 2 months)
    - Education
        - Notifiable disease - contact state public health unit
        - Patient should isolate (particularly from other children)
        - Check immunisation status
- Management of public health issues around pertussis
    - Public health measures indicated as pertussis is highly contagious
        - 80% of susceptible household contacts develop clinical disease after exposure
        - A notifiable disease to state PHU
    - Isolation
        - Infected patients should be advised to avoid contact with others until FIVE days of antibiotic therapy
    - Contact tracing
        - Close contact: any individual who has been within 1 metre of an infectious case for > 1 hour
        - High risk contacts given post-exposure prophylaxis (azithromycin)
            - Most effective when initiated within 21 days of cough onset of the index patient
            - High-risk contacts include:
                - Infants < 6 months (RCH)
                - Pregnant women
                - Co-morbidities
                    - Immunodeficient individuals
                    - Persons with underlying medical conditions
                        - E.g. chronic lung disease, respiratory insufficiency, cystic fibrosis
                - Occupations
                    - People with regular contact with infants
        - Check immunisation status of all children in the same household as the infected patient
            - DTP-a vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months
