- Classification of IE
    - Can be subclassified clinically or based on the location of infection
        - Clinical
            - Subacute (wks-mths)
                - prev. damaged valves infected by organisms (e.g. S. viridans → express dextrans → bind to fibrin-platelet aggregates on damaged valves)
            - Acute (days-wks)
                - Serious infection on previously normal valve
                - Destructive necrotising lesions
                - Virulent organisms (e.g. S. aureus)
        - Location
            - Native valve (often S. aureus or enterococcus)
            - Prosthetic valve (Staph. epidermidis, enterococci)
            - Right sided endocarditis (IVDU - S. aureus, Pseudomonas, Candida)
- Investigative approach to infective endocarditis
    - Principal diagnostic investigations (guided by Duke’s Criteria)
        - Blood cultures (3 sets; 3 different sites)
            - At least **ONE** **before ABx** (don’t delay tx)
        - Echocardiogram (TOE more sensitive than TTE)
    - Ancillary
        - Bedside
            - ECG - pericarditis, PE
            - Urinalysis → signs of secondary GN
            - Blood gas - respiratory status
        - Labs
            - FBC
            - UEC, LFT
            - CRP
            - Consider
                - Full septic screen
                - Serial troponins (MI)
                - Coagulations panel and D-dimer (PE)
                - Rheumatological screen
        - Imaging
            - CXR
            - D-dimer or CTPA
- Why is IE so difficult to treat?
    - Vegetations contain densely packed bacteria interlocked within a biofilm composed of fibrin and platelets
        - Creates a mechanical barrier which limits antibiotic penetration
        - Valves receive poor blood supply
    - Resistance
        - Antibiotic resistance is a key challenge
            - Note: S. mitis has a high resistance to penicillins (B-lactamase, PBP gene mutation to reduce binding affinity)
- Echocardiogram findings in IE
    - Hyperechoic mass located on the valve, prosthetic material, mural endocardium
    - Complications
        - New valvular vegetation
        - Perivalvular abscess
        - Prosthetic valve dehiscence
    - Most likely affected → mitral > aortic
- TTE v TOE
    - TTE is preferred for all suspected IE initially
        - Non-invasive, specific
        - Cannot visualise vegetations < 2mm
        - Should not use in emphysema patients, excess body habitus, prosthetic valves
    - TOE
        - Invasive but more sensitive and specific
        - Better at visualising mitral lesions and development of possible aortic root abscess
        - First-line for more high-risk patients or inconclusive TTE
- CXR abnormalities in IE
    - Chest findings are non-specific
    - May identify:
        - Calcification on valves
        - Signs due to septic emboli to the lungs
            - Diffuse unilateral or bilateral nodular opacities representing pneumonia or septic emboli impaction
            - Lung abscess
            - Pleural effusions
            - Signs of PE (Hampton hump, Westernmark sign)
        - Signs of CCF (ABCDE of APO)
        - Pericardial effusion
- Most commonly affected valve in IE
    - IVDU - tricuspid valve
        - Pathogens enter the venous circulation during non-sterile injecting practices
            - S. aureus most likely - commensal skin flora
        - Tricuspid is the first valve encountered (damaged from injected contents + lower pressures and turbulence contributes to infection)
    - Non-IVDU
        - Aortic valve (most common)
            - Follows mitral degeneration in rheumatic heart disease or degenerative disease
        - Mitral valve (native or rheumatic heart disease)
- How are blood cultures performed
    - Procedure: take multiple sets of cultures (aerobic, anaerobic) from different sites
        - 3 sets of cultures from three different sites for IE → 96% chance for detecting bacteraemia
            - 1 set prior to ABx (ideally 2)
        - 2 sets from 2 different sites for other indications
    - Steps
        1. Collect equipment
            1. Sterile gloves, small dressing pack, cotton balls, tape, tourniquet
            2. 2% chlorhexidine and 70% alcohol swabs
            3. Prepare vials by disinfecting top and marking 10mL above culture liquid level
        2. Site preparation
            1. Wear PPE
            2. Apply tourniquet and find site
            3. Wear sterile gloves
            4. Swab area with wipe (aseptic technique)
        3. Perform venepuncture
            1. Fill aerobic before anaerobic (green first)
            2. Send to lab ASAP
    - Lab procedure
        - Incubated at body temperature for up to 5 days
        - Growth detected
            - Bottom of the bottle changes colour when there is sufficient growth
                - Due to production of CO2 and change in pH
                - Negative = no colour change in 5 days
            - Subcultures to isolate the pathogenic organism
- Contents of blood cultures
    - Aerobic first, then anaerobic
        - Aerobic contains oxygen
        - Anaerobic contains reducing agent (e.g. glucose) to aid growth
    - Contents
        - Nutrient broth
            - Allows growth of organisms until there is enough to be cultured on agar
            - Includes water, nitrogen, growth factors, trace elements

            - Neutralises natural bactericidal action of blood
        - Resin beads

- Likely causative organisms in IE
    - Most likely organism depends on the clinical situation
        - Acute (days-weeks)

        - Other fungi → aspergillus spp.
- Pathophysiology of IE
    1. Bacteraemia (e.g. IVDU, post dental procedure)
    2. Adherence of organism to valvular vegetation
        - Low virulence organisms need to invade sterile fibrin-platelet vegetations
            - Form from pre-existing valvular diseases or hypercoagulable conditions
        - High virulence organisms can directly invade and injure endocardium (produces an infective fibrin-platelet vegetation)
        - Adhesion of platelets and fibrin protect this vegetation from the immune system (also avascular valve leaflet)
    3. Invasion of organism into valve leaflets
        - Leukocytosis and subsequent release of proteolytic enzymes by neutrophils → friable vegetation
        - Systemic cytokine release
    4. Complications (e.g. septic emboli)
        1. Embolisation associated with increased inflammation (proteolysis - PMNs)
- Strep. viridans
    - Gram positive, a-haemolytic coccus
        - Optochin resistant (differentiates from S. pneumoniae → alpha-haemolytic)
    - Normal flora of the oropharynx which cause dental caries (S. mutans, S. mitis) or subacute IE (S. sanguinis)
        - S. sanguinis makes dextrans which bind to fibrin-platelet aggregates on damaged heart valves
- S. aureus - virulence factors
    - Evade immune defences
        - Coagulase → converts fibrinogen to fibrin and encloses/walls off the organisms to protect from phagocytosis
        - Catalase → protects from ROS
        - Protein A → inhibits opsonisation, fixing complement and phagocytosis
        - Haemolysins and leukocidins → destroy RBCs and WCs
        - Antibiotic resistance (B-lactamase, mutated PBP)
    - Local destruction
        - Hyaluronidase → break down proteoglycans in connective tissue to enable local invasion
        - Staphylokinase → activates plasminogen → plasmin
        - Protease
        - DNAse → breaks down DNA and reduces viscosity of infective materal
        - Lipase → breaks down fats and oils for cutaneous colonisation
    - Toxins
        - Superantigens (toxic-shock syndrome toxin)
- Treatment of IE
    - Supportive treatment
        - Continuous vital monitoring
        - Fluid and electrolyte resuscitation as needed

            - Native valve
                - Benzylpenicillin (S. viridans)
                - Flucloxacillin (MSSA)
                    - Vancomycin (if MRSA risk) → known coloniser, IVDU, prosthetic valve, nosocomial infection
                - Gentamicin (dosing interval based on renal function)
            - Prosthetic valve, IVDU, sepsis
                - Flucloxacillin + vancomycin + gentamicin
        - **Directed therapy based on causative organism and sensitivities**
            - Enterococcal → ampicillin + gentamicin
            - HACEK organisms (atypical fastidious organisms associated with IE)
                - Treat with cefotaxime (3rd generation)
    - Adjunctive therapies
        - Assess need to remove any infected implant devices or AV access
