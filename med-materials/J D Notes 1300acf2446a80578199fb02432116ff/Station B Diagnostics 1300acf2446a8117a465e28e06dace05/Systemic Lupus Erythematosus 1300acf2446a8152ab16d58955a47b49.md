# Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

## Case Protocol 24 – **Systemic Lupus Erythematous**

*A 27-year-old woman presented to her GP with a persistent facial rash and loss of scalp hair. She gave a history of Raynaud phenomena occurring during the previous three winters, and glomerulonephritis several years ago.*

*Examination revealed an erythematous rash over the malar region of her face and bridge of the nose. Her hands were pale and cold, with soft tissue swelling of the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands.*

                - Anti-Scl 70 (scleroderma)
                - **Anti-SSA (Ro) or SSB (La)** → Sjogren’s, SLE
                - Anti-U1 RNP → mixed CT disease
                - Anti-Jo1 → myositis
            - RF and anti-CCP (rule out RA)
        - Antiphospholipid antibodies

            - Anti-B2 glycoprotein 1
            - Lupus anticoagulant

    - Pancytopaenia with raised ESR
        - Normocytic, normochromic anaemia
            - Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (SLE autoantibody mediated destruction)
            - Chronic kidney disease (low EPO)
            - Anaemia of chronic inflammation

        - ESR can be more sensitive than CRP in SLE
- ANA testing - method, interpretation, limitations, implications
    - Method
        - Testing with immunofluorescence
            - Patient serum is added to a slide with fixed cells and incubated
                - Uses HEp-2 cell line (cells with large nuclei to highlight staining pattern)
                - Washed to remove any non-adherent Ig
            - Remaining antibodies are bound to an antigen in the cells (ANA binds to nuclear antigens)
                - Visualised by adding a fluorescent anti-human antibody
                - **ANA positive → nucleus stains green**
            - I**ntensity is measured by dilution (e.g. ≥ 1:80 for ACR criteria)**
                - Endpoint when fewer than half the cells on the slide show detectable fluorescence with serial dilutions
                - Allows quantification as patient’s with higher levels of ANA will continue to return positive results at higher saline dilutions relative to a patient with lower levels
        - Testing with ELISA
            - Solid phase assays
                - Panel of purified native or recombinant autoantigens prepared and immobilised on a solid surface
                    - Diluted human serum incubated with immobilised antigen
                    - A second antibody is added (similar to indirect immunofluorescence) to detect bound autoantibodies
                - Able to be automated for high-volume ANA testing
    - Patterns of immunofluorescent staining
        
        
        | Pattern | Antibody targets | Disease association |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Homogenous | dsDNA, ssDNA, histones | SLE, drug induced lupus, JIA |
        | Speckled | Ro, La, Scl70, Smith, U1 RNP | Sjogren’s, SLE, MCTD, scleroderma |
        | Centromere | centromere proteins | CREST |
        | Nucleolar | Nucleolar RNA | Scleroderma, polymyositis |
    - Limitations
        - Moderate intensity ANA is present in 5-15% of healthy normal population
            - Clinical pre-test probability is important for interpretation
        - Highly sensitive for some rheumatic diseases (e.g. SLE, sclerodera)
            - Low NPV for many (e.g. RA, seronegative spondyloarthropathies, vasculitides)
    - Implications
        - Positive ANA in a relevant clinical situation needs to be followed by with immunological panel (including ENA)
        - 1:80 relevant for ACR, 1:160 generally is clinically significant
- Urinalysis in SLE, implications
    
    Stem: *Microscopy of urine revealed 100 erythrocytes/mL, with both red and white cell casts, as well as granular casts present in the urinary sediment…*
    
    - Casts are aggregates of cells or debris which represent the form and diameter of kidney tubules
        - Red cell casts suggests GN
        - White cell casts suggest GN or pyelomephritis
    - Interpretation
        - Suggestive of nephritic syndrome secondary to SLE
        - SLE can cause a range of GN from minimal change to diffuse proliferative GN
    - Implications
        - Further investigations should be performed
            - UEC (eGFR)
            - 24h urinary protein
            - Abdominal CT or US
            - Consider renal biopsy
- Histological findings in skin biopsy - SLE
    - Normal skin in SLE (less sun exposed)
        - Band of immune complex deposition at dermo-epidermal junction
        - SLE is systemic and microscopic pathology seen
    - Involved skin
        - Positive band of immune complex deposition at dermo-epidermal junction (as above)
        - Vacuolar degeneration of basal cell layer → excess water accumulation
            - Oedema
        - Lymphocytic infiltration of upper dermis and around blood vessels
            - Extravasation of RBCs
- What organ systems can be affected in SLE
    - Cutaneous
        - Malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers
    - MSK
        - Polyarticular non-erosive arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia
    - Cardiac
        - Pancarditis (risk of Libmann-Sacks endocarditis → can form NBTE)
    - Respiratory
        - Pleuritis, effusion, ILD (fibrosis)
    - Haematological
        - Pancytopaenia
    - Renal
        - Glomerulonephritis, CKD
    - Neuropsychiatric
        - Seizures, psychosis and cognitive impairment
    - Other: associated with vasculitis, Sjogren’s syndrome, Raynaud phenomenon
    - Constitutional
        - Fatigue, fever, weight loss, malaise
- Pathophysiology of SLE
    - Incompletely understood - thought to be complex interaction with genetic predisposition and environmental stimuli
    - Complement hypothesis
        - Deficiency of complement proteins leads to failure of macrophages to phagocytosis apoptotic cell material (e.g. plasma and nuclear antigens)
            - Dysregulated lymphocytes target these normally hidden intracellular antigens → autoantibody production
        - Autoantibodies form complexes with antigens (type III hypersensitivity) and deposit in microvasculature
            - Activate complement and inflammatory cascade → damage to tissues

### Past question: SLE (diagnostics)

**Case:**

*A 34-year-old woman presented with facial rash, marked hair loss, sore joints and previous 4 miscarriages. She has proteinuria and a high ANA titre. Over the last 3 weeks she was fatigued, had recurrent fevers and developed small erythematous papules in periungal area, which were tender but non blanching on palpation.*

- PDx

    - Recurrent miscarriages may suggests antiphospholipid syndrome
- What is a malar rash? Photosensitivity in SLE?
    - Malar rash
        - Symmetrical, erythematous or purplish non-pruritic rash which overlies the nasal bridge and cheeks
            - Spares nasolabial folds
            - Butterfly distribution
        - DDx: rosacea (erythematotelangiectatic)
    - Photosensitivity in SLE
        - UV radiation leads to apoptosis of cells and exposure of DNA to autoantibodies
            - Formation of immune complexes and local deposition in tissue (type 3 hypersensitivity) → inflammatory response
            - UB is also associated with the release of inflammatory cytokines

- What is lupus anticoagulant
    - An autoantibody against phospholipids and proteins on the cell membranes of platelets and monocytes
        - Binds to the cell membranes of these cells → increases platelet adhesion and aggregation
        - Predisposes to thrombosis
    - Note: misnomer as it is an anticoagulant IN VITRO (binds to phospholipids in serum and prevents clotting in laboratory)
    - Assess through (step-wise):
        - aPTT (prolonged)
        - Mixing test (prolonged)
        - Phospholipid-sensitive clotting test (dilute Russell’s viper venom time) [prolonged]

            - Sun protection (avoid UV)
        - Counselling around disease, pregnancy (caution in active flares)
    - Pharmacological → highly individualised on patient and disease factors
