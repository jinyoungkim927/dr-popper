# Acute Myeloid Leukemia

*A **45-year-old woman** presented to her local doctor with a three-week history of **easy bruising** and **menorrhagia**, associated with **increasing fatigue** and **intermittent fever**. Physical examination revealed a **pale, thin person** with **prominent ecchymoses** on her arms, legs and abdomen. The **spleen was “tippable”** beneath the costal margin and there was slight **bony tenderness** over the sternum.*

- PDx and DDx

- AML - complications
    - Related to:

        - **Proliferation of blasts**
            - Leukostasis syndrome
                - High blast concentration interferes with circulation and causes microvascular occlusion and tissue hypoxia
                    - Leads to infarction
                    - May present like DIC
                - Medical emergency
