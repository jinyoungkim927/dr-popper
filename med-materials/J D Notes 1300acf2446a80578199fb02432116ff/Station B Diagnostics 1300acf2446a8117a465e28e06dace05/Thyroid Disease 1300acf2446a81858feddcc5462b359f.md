    ![Screen Shot 2020-04-06 at 1.15.45 pm.png](Thyroid%20Disease%201300acf2446a81858feddcc5462b359f/Screen_Shot_2020-04-06_at_1.15.45_pm.png)
    
    - These TFTs show elevated TSH and decreased T3 and T4 (primary hypothyroidism)
        - Increased TSH due to decreased negative feedback on the pituitary (low T3/T4)
    - Note: subclinical (compensated) hypothyroidism is a low-normal T4 and mildly elevated TSH without clinical findings
        - Thyroxine is not indicated (simple follow-up in 3 months (< 5% progress to clinically significant hypothyroidism)
- Hashimotoâ€™s disease - macroscopic and microscopic features
    - Macroscopic - the thyroid gland will be:
        - Firm
        - Moderately enlarged
        - Lobulated
        - Non-tender
    - Microscopic characterisations:
        - Lymphocytic infiltrate with formation of lymphoid follicles
        - Infiltration of plasma cells
        - Fibrosis
        - Atrophic follicles lined by **Hurthle cells**

- Hashimotoâ€™s disease - pathophysiology
    - **Largely a type IV hypersensitivity reaction**
    - Cause is a combination of:
        - Genetic factors (e.g. association with polymorphisms in MHC Class II loci (HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR5)
        - Environmental factors (e.g. infection, stress)
    - Pathophysiology
        - Antigen presenting cells process thyroid antigens and initiate an aberrant immune response
            - Activation and infiltration by T and B cells
        - Activated CD4 T cells â†’ assist B cell differentiation, antibody production and cytokine release
        - **Activated CD8 T cells â†’ induce apoptotic destruction of thyroid cells**
        - Activated B cells â†’ antibody secretion
            - Produce anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin
                - These appear to be a secondary phenomenon
- Hashimotoâ€™s disease - levothyroxine (goals of treatment, mechanism, AEs)
    - Goals: euthyroidism to reduce symptoms and prevent long-term complications
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ“Œ
    
    Treatment approach â†’ start long go slow 
    
    </aside>
    
    - Levothyroxine (synthetic T4) â†’ replacement therapy
        - Mechanism
            - T4 is deiodinated peripherally to T3 which binds to nuclear receptors and exerts metabolic effects through control of DNA transcription
        - Note: T4 replacement requires life-long monitoring with regular TSH levels for 4-6 weeks after commencing therapy (then every 12 months)
            - Risk of overcorrection
        - AEs
            - Thyrotoxicosis
                - Tachycardia, tremor, heat intolerance
                - Increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g. AF)
                - Increased risk of osteoporosis
                - Adrenal crisis if given with primary adrenal insufficiency
                    - ACTH stimulation test (short synacthen)
- Hashimotoâ€™s - link to peripheral neuropathy
    - A number of possible causes exist:
        1. Impaired neuronal transmission in hypothyroidism
        2. Pernicious anaemia (autoimmune polyglandular cluster) [B12 deficiency â†’ SCD]
        3. Peripheral n. entrapment (deposition of hydrophilic GAGs and peripheral oedema)
        4. Diabetes (T1DM association)
        5. Nutritional deficiency (thiamine, folate, alcoholic)
- Hashimotoâ€™s - complications
    - Hypothyroidism can cause complications in many organ systems and often relate to slowing of metabolic processes and GAG accumulation
    - Cardiovascular
        - Hypercholesterolaemia (accelerated atherosclerosis)
        - Reduced CO (worsens CCF)
        - hypoTN
        - pericardial effusion
    - Neuropsychiatric
        - Hypoactivity, lethargy, depression, pseudodementia
    - GI
        - Hypomotility (faecal impaction and malabsorption (bacterial overgrowth))
    - Reproductive
        - Infertility and decreased libido
    - MSK
        - Myopathy
        - Carpal tunnel syndrome
        - Myxoedema
- Hashimoto's - if your patient returned with profound fatigue, sinus bradycardia, periorbital oedema and blunted reflexes, what would this complication be?
    - Suggests myxoedema coma â†’ slowing of function in multiple organs
        - Medical emergency â†’ 40-50% mortality
    - Features
        - Profound lethargy or coma
        - Weakness
        - Hypothermia
        - Hypoventilation
        - Hypoglycaemia
        - Hyponatraemia
    - Pathophysiology
        - Low T3/T4 levels leads to substantial reductions in metabolic rate and decreased O2 consumption
        - Precipitants include stressed states (infection, ACS, surgery), cold exposure, administration of drugs (esp. sedatives like opioids)
            - Decreased drug metabolism â†’ risk of medication overdose

- Describe the synthesis of thyroid hormone
    1. Na/iodide (I-) symporter moves iodide into the follicular cell 
        1. Intracellular iodide concentration is 20x higher than follicular lumen (establishes concentration gradient)
        2. Gradient drives iodide across apical membrane into colloid via two pathways
            1. Pendrin moves iodide into colloid (anion exchange)
            2. ANO1 (anion channel selective for iodide)
    2. Follicular cell synthesises thyroglobulin and secretes into follicular lumen
    3. Thyroid peroxidase acts in the colloid
        1. Oxidation
            - Iodide is oxidised and formed into iodine (I2)
        2. Iodination
            - Iodine is organified (covalently linked to tyrosine) which creates monoiodothyronine (MIT) and DIT
        3. Conjugation
            - MIT and DIT are coupled into thyroglobulin
    4. Peroxidase-processed thyroglobulin is endocytosed by follicular cells when thyroid gland is stimulated to make thyroid hormones (hence, a reservoir exists)
    5. Lysosomes break down thyroglobulin â†’ release of T3 and T4
    6. Iodine atoms of MIT and DIT are recycled

### Memorandum: Gravesâ€™ (Pharm)

35F with anxiety and irritability presents to GP. Also had tremor. Some weight loss over the last few months. HR 140, BP 145/90, temp 37.6, negative U/A. ECG shows sinus tachy.

- Treatment of Gravesâ€™ disease
    - Pharmacology
        - Antithyroid drugs are first-line for initial presentations (aim for remission (euthyroid) within 3-8 weeks)
            - Examples
                - Methimazole OR carbimazole (can be dosed once daily)
                    - Divided doses can help with GI toxicity at higher doses
                    - Carbimazole is the pro-drug for methimazole
                - Propylthiouracil (200-600mg PO) â†’ divided into 2 or 3 daily doses
            - Mechanism
                - **Inhibits thyroid-peroxidase (TPO) catalysed iodination** of thyroglobulin tyrosine residues
                    - **Decreases numbers of MIT and DIT**
                    - Also inhibit **TPO-catalysed coupling of iodotyrosines to form T3 and T4**
                - **PTU also blocks de-iodination of T4-T3 in peripheral tissues (via 5â€™-deiodinase)**
            - Use
                - Carbimazole preferred due to longer duration of action, more rapid efficacy and lower incidence of side effects
                    - Methimazole or carbimazole is suitable for use in pregnancy after 2nd trimester (discuss with patient)
                - **PTU preferred in pregnancy and lactation (less teratogenic)**
                    - **Used in 1st trimester**
                    - Risk of hepatoxicity with longer-term use
                - Long-term therapy is an appropriate option for hyperthyroidism management (not all patients need ablation)
            - AEs
                - Vomiting
                - Anorexia
                - Rash and pruritus

        - Radiotherapy thyroid ablation I-131
            - PO capsule or solution of sodium iodine-131 â†’ concentrates in thyroid tissue and induces extensive damage (ablation in 6-18 weeks)
            - May cause:
                - Hypothyroidism
                - **Increased risk of thyroid eye disease** (may be ameliorated with glucocorticoid treatment)
