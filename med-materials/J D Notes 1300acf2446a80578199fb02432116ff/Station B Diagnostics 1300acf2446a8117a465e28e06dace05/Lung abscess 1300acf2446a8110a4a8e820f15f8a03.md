    - CXR
        - Shows a cavitating lung lesion in the right middle zone surrounded by consolidation with an air-fluid level in the inferior border
            - Suggestive of a lung abscess
        - Typical abscess appearance on imaging
            - Approximately round in shape
            - Possess a thick wall surrounded by consolidation
            - May contain only fluid or have an air-fluid level (if eroded into bronchus)
            - Bronchus can be traced to the wall of the abscess (truncated here)
    - Pathophysiology of S. aureus and abscess
        - Occurs due to fibrinosuppurative exudation, with necrosis and tissue destruction, that is walled off by fibrin
        - Virulence factors of S. aureus help evade immune defences and cause local destruction
            - Evade immune defences
                - Coagulase → converts fibrinogen to fibrin and encloses/walls off the organisms to protect from phagocytosis
                - Catalase → protects from ROS
                - Protein A → inhibits opsonisation, fixing complement and phagocytosis
                - Haemolysins and leukocidins → destroy RBCs and WCs
                - Antibiotic resistance (B-lactamase, mutated PBP)
            - Local destruction
                - Hyaluronidase → break down proteoglycans in connective tissue to enable local invasion
