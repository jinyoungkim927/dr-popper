# Alcoholic liver disease

## Case Protocol 22 – **Alcoholic Cirrhosis**

*A 63-year-old woman was referred to her local hospital for assessment of ankle oedema and weakness. She had been divorced for 23 years and lived alone. She had previously worked as a cook in the local RSL club but had been on sickness benefits for the past 15 years because of depression. She smoked 40 cigarettes a day and drank 5-6 glasses of sherry per day.*

*Examination revealed a woman who looked older than her stated age. Her gait was ataxic. Pitting oedema was present in both lower limbs. The abdomen was distended and tense, with shifting dullness. The liver was not palpable; however, the spleen was palpable 3 cm below the costal margin. Rectal examination revealed bleeding haemorrhoids.*

    - Cirrhosis is a condition characterised by extensive scarring and fibrosis of the hepatic parenchyma
        - Due to chronic inflammation and represents a maladaptive attempt at healing which produces peri-sinusoidal fibrosis
        - Nodules of regenerating hepatocytes surrounded by fibrotic bands → presents with liver failure
    - Results in portal hypertension and decreased metabolic function
    - Explain ascites, oesohageal varices/haemorrhoids, splenomegaly
        - Ascites
            - Imbalance in Starling’s forces
                - Increased hydrostatic forces

            - **Related to formation of porto-systemic anastomoses**
            - Risk of excess bleeding due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors (can be fatal)
        - Splenomegaly
            - Develops due to backflow from the portal vein into its tributaries (including splenic vein)
                - Spleen becomes congested due to its large capacity to store blood

                - Megaloblastic
        - Leukopaenia
            - May be due to reduced bone marrow production and sequestration
        - Thrombocytopaenia
            - Decreased TPO production

### Past question: alcoholic liver disease (diagnostics)

*An elderly divorced lady presents with bilateral pitting oedema and a tense abdomen. On closer examination you find that there is shifting dullness, splenomegaly and bleeding haemorrhoids on rectal examination. She drinks 6-8 glasses of sherry a day and smokes 10-15 cigarettes daily. Her liver function test results are below.*

- Pathophysiology of bruising in cirrhosis
    - Reduced synthesis of clotting factors and thrombopoietin
    - Malnutrition (secondary to alcoholism)
        - Vitamin K deficiency
            - Reduced synthesis of clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X)
        - Vitamin C deficiency
            - Poor collagen synthesis → weak blood vessels
- Pathophysiology of pitting oedema in cirrhosis
    - Occurs with extravasation of protein-deficient fluid into the interstitial fluid (e.g. hepatic or renal hypoalbuminaemia)
        - When clinician presses on the site of oedema, the manual pressure forces fluid back into capillaries and lymphatics
            - When pressure is removed, it ‘pits’ as there is no immediate oncotic force pushing it back into interstitium
    - The fluid will eventually leak out again (but slowly) → e.g. under hydrostatic force in legs due to gravity

### Past question: alcoholic liver disease (pharmacology)

*Gerard is a 36-year-old miner who works several months a year in the mines. He presents with nausea and vomiting to the ED. He also describes stools that do not “stick together”. He has palmar erythema, spider naevi and is jaundiced with a mild fever. His history is remarkable for alcohol consumption of 12-15 beers a day when he is “on the job”.*

        - Oculomotor dysfunction (nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsies)
        - Gait ataxia
    - Pathophysiology
        - Thiamine deficiency develops in the context of excess alcohol intake due to inadequate nutrition and decreased hepatic storage
        - Active form of thiamine (TPP) is a co-factor for several enzymes including those in cellular glucose metabolism
            - Brain is dependent on glucose metabolism and hence susceptible to injury
    - Treatment
        - IV thiamine 300mg TDS for 3 days and then wean
        - Thiamine replacement life-long
- What is Korsakoff syndrome
    - Chronic thiamine deficiency leads to irreversible damage to the mammillary bodies and components of the limbic system
    - Manifestations
        - Anterograde and retrograde memory deficits
        - Confabulation
        - Personality changes (e.g. apathy)
        - Lack of insight
        - Psychosis
        - Disorientation
    - Often preserved long-term memory, attention and other executive skills

- Describe ligaments associated with the liver
    - Falciform ligament
        - Peritoneal fold passing from the umbilicus or anterior abdominal wall (up to xiphisternum) to the visceral surface of the liver
            - Free edge contains the ligamentum teres
    - Left triangular ligament
        - Formed by the left layer of the falciform
    - Coronary ligament
        - Upper layer is a continuation of the right layer of the falciform
            - Surrounds th**e bare area of the liver**
        - **Lower layer descends over the R kidney and R paracolic gutter to form the hepatorenal pouch (Morrison’s pouch)**
            - Encloses the caudate lobe (only part of liver in the lesser sac)
    - Right triangular ligament
        - Formed by the union of the two layers of the coronary ligament
    - Lesser omentum

- Describe the blood supply and portal triads of the liver
    - Blood from two sources
        - Arterial (oxygenated) from the hepatic artery (30% flow and 50% O2)
            - L and R branches from the porta hepatis → divides into segmental branches
        - Venous blood from the portal vein (70% flow and 50% O2)
            - L and R branches in the porta
    - There is no mixing between L and R halves in portal or hepatic artery flow
- Describe the venous drainage of the liver
    - Arterial and portal are mixed in the sinusoids → central vein (within each lobule) → hepatic veins
    - Three main hepatic veins with no extra hepatic course
        - Left
        - Right
        - Middle
            - Runs in the plane between left and right and receives blood from both
            - Often joins the left hepatic vein
    - There is mixing from the left and right halves of the liver
- Lymphatic drainage of liver
    - Hepatic nodes (porta hepatis) → retropyloric nodes → coeliac nodes
        - May be involved in retrograde metastasis if a cancer infiltrates the retropyloric nodes → obstructive jaundice
    - Extraperitoneal lymphatics
        - Travel through diaphragm → posterior mediastinal nodes (from bare area and triangular ligaments)
- Lobes of the liver (anatomical, functional)
    - Anatomical
        - Falciform ligament and grooves for ligamentum teres and venosum divides into L and R lobes
            - Quadrate and caudate in R lobe
    - Functional
        - Principal plane (between gallbladder fossa and IVC) divides lobes into functional halves which reflect blood and bile flow
- Histology of the hepatic parenchyma
    - Liver divided into lobules (hexagonal and arranged around a central vein)
        - Hepatocytes arranged into cellular plates (2 cells thick) which radiate like spokes on a wheel
    - At the corners of each lobule are portal canals
        - Contain branches of the hepatic artery, portal vein and bile ductules
        - Between hepatocytes exist bile canaliculi which form intralobular ducts → interlobular ducts
    - Between cellular plates are sinusoids (lined by endothelium)
        - Possess frequent intercellular spaces and fenestrations which allow plasma to enter the perisinusoidal spaces (of Disse)
        - Blood in the sinusoids are from hepatic and portal systems (mixed)
            - Hepatocytes nearest the central vein receive the lowest O2 tension
    - Special cells
        - Kupffer cells (phagocytes)
        - Stellate cells (produce growth factors, collagen)

- Suprarenal gland (general anatomy, blood supply and venous drainage)
    - Two glands which lie within their own compartment of renal fascia superior to the kidney
        - Right
            - Superior part is in contact with the bare area of liver and only the lower half is covered by peritoneum
        - Left
            - Inferior part is covered by pancreas and splenic artery
            - Superior part covered by peritoneum
    - Blood supply origin
        - Inferior phrenic (superior suprarenal)
        - Abdominal aorta (middle suprarenal)
        - Renal (inferior suprarenal)
    - Venous drainage (often a single vein)
        - Right → IVC
        - Left → left renal vein
