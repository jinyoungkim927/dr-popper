# Von Willebrand disease

## Case Protocol 8 – **von Willebrand disease**

*An 18-year-old woman was brought by ambulance to the Emergency Department with uncontrolled haemorrhage following extraction of a wisdom tooth at a dentist’s surgery. She had always “bruised easily” and often experienced “heavy periods”, but there had been no previous operations.*

*On examination, she was pale and extremely anxious, with cool extremities. Vital signs were as shown opposite.*

- Provisional Dx
    - von Willebrand factor disease
        - Easy bruising, menorrhagia, and haemorrhage post dental procedures suggests disorder of **primary haemostasis**
        - Long standing suggests **inherited**
- Differentials for bleeding diathesis
    - Disorders of primary haemostasis
        - Inability to form a platelet plug due to disorder of blood vessels, platelets or vWF
            - Presentation: superficial mucocutaneous bleeding which occurs immediately after minor trauma, skin lacerations or dental extractions (i.e. mucosa)
                - Form petechiae and ecchymoses - often controllable
        - Causes
            - Platelets
                - Thrombocytopaenias
                    - E.g. ITP, TTP, HUS
                    - Bone marrow failure
                - Platelet function abnormalities
                    - Congenital - vWF disease, Bernard-Soulier syndrome
                    - Acquired - uraemia, NSAID use
            - Blood vessels
                - Congenital (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4), acquired (vasculitis)
    - Disorders of secondary haemostasis
        - Inability to form an adequate fibrin clot due to disorder of factors, proteins
            - Presentation: delayed, massive bleeds often internal (joints, muscle, GIT, genitourinary)
        - Causes
            - Clotting factor deficiencies
                - Haemophilia A, B, C
                - Vitamin K deficiency
                - Liver failure
                - Consumptive - DIC
                - Anticoagulation therapy
            - Excess fibrinolysis
                - Deficiencies in plasmin or plasminogen inhibitors
    - Both
        - DIC (consumption of platelets, clotting factors, fibrinogen)
        - Severe liver failure (decreased synthesis of TPO, clotting factors)
- Physiology of platelet and vWF function
    - Activated platelets bind to damaged endothelium via GpIa molecules and indirectly via GpIb molecule (binds to vWF which binds to exposed collagen)
        - Platelets bind fibrinogen via GpIIb/IIIa
    - vWF
        - Synthesised by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes
        - Primary haemostasis
            - Acts as a platelet adhesion molecule (binds platelets to exposed collagen via GpIb)
        - Secondary haemostasis
            - Binds factor VIII and prevents its degradation
        - Types
            - 1: quantitative decrease in vWF
            - 2: functional decrease in vWF (abnormalities of binding)
            - 3: complete deficiency
- What is vWF disease
    - A disorder which causes a mild-moderate reduction in vWF (most common form is type 1 - AD)
    - vWF has two main physiological contributions
        - Forms a necessary bridge between subendothelial collagen and glycoprotein Ib on platelet surfaces
            - Helps form bridges between platelets to aid aggregation
            - Necessary for platelet adherence and aggregation
            - Deficiency = failure of primary haemostatic plug
        - Carrier for Factor VIII (required for intrinsic cascade) → contributes to secondary haemostatic plug
            - Deficiency = prolongation of aPTT
- Approach to Hx and exam in bleeding disorders
    - Aim: determine mechanism of bleeding diathesis and possible underlying cause
    - History
        - Presenting complaint
            - Characterise the bleeding event
                - Location
                - Nature of injury (minor or major trauma)
            - Complications of bleeding event (dizziness, palpitations, confusion, headache)
        - Identify and characterise pattern of historical bleeds
            - New onset of bleeding tendency? Tendency since childhood
            - Suggestive of primary haemostasis disorder
                - Superficial mucocutaneous bleeds (epistaxis, dental)
                - Petechiae and ecchymoses
                - Controllable with direct pressure
            - Suggestive of secondary haemostasis disorder
                - Significant, massive bleeds (often deep in body - haemarthroses, deep muscle haematomas, GI and GU tract bleeds)
                - Results in excessive bleeding post-trauma
        - Medication Hx (anticoagulation)
        - FHx of bleeding diatheses
        - SHx - EtOH
    - Examination
        - Haematological exam
            - Thrombocytopaenia (petechiae, mucosal membrane petechiae, ecchymoses)
            - Anaemia - pallor
            - Malignancy - bony tenderness, lymphadenopathy
        - Abdominal examination
            - Signs of liver failure - portal hypertension
            - Splenomegaly
- Investigative approach for von Willebrand disease
    - Principal screening and diagnostic investigations
        - Coagulation studies
            - Normal PT, elevated aPTT
        - vWF antigen → low
            - Abnormal = score < 30% or score < 50% with bleeding
        - Ristocetin cofactor assay (cofactor for vWF and platelet binding - functional) → low
            - Surrogate measure of effective binding between vWF and Gp1b on platelet membrane
            - Concordance between vWF and ristocetin indicates type 1
                - Type 2 has a primary deficit in functional binding (RCo-vWF assay)
        - Factor VIII (may be decreased)
            - vWF protects VIII from proteolysis (DDx is haemophilia A (VIII deficiency))
        - Note:
            - Repeat vWF antigen and ristocetin cofactor assay to confirm diagnosis
            - Tests to identify subtype
                - vWF multimer analysis
                - Further functional assays
                    - Ristocetin induced platelet aggregation (type 2B)
                    - Factor VIII level to vWF-Ag (type 2N)
    - Ancillary
        - FBC (anaemia (if other cause), platelet levels)
        - Blood film
        - Iron studies - investigate Fe deficient anaemia
        - Consider bone marrow biopsy and trephine if considering malignancy
        - Genetic testing for vWF mutation
- Interpret the haematology and coagulation results

    - FBC
        - Microcytic hypochromic anaemia
            - Iron deficiency due to chronic heavy menstrual bleeding (as per case)
        - Thrombocytosis
            - Likely reactive in response to bleeding
    - Tests of haemostasis
        - Prolonged aPTT → abnormal intrinsic and/or common pathway
        - Normal PT → normal extrinsic and common pathway
        - Low vWF
        - Low RCo-vWF assay
    - Summary
        - Results consistent for vWF deficiency
            - Justifies the need for the specific ristocetin test (measures vWF functional activity by measuring induced platelet aggregation through adding ristocetin)
        - As both vWF Ag and RCo-vWF assay are low → quantitative drop in vWF (type 1)
- Inheritance pattern of vWF disease
    - vWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder (1:100)
        - Types 1 and 2 are inherited via autosomal dominant pattern
        - Type 3 (absolute deficiency) inherited via autosomal recessive pattern
        - Demonstrates variable penetrance within families
    - Acquired vWD is possible - has been linked to the following conditions
        - Antibody-mediated decreases (monoclonal gammopathies, autoimmune diseases)
        - Shear stress-induced proteolysis (aortic stenosis, HOCM)
        - Decreased synthesis (hypothyroidism)
- Management of vWF disease
    - Goal: replace deficient protein at time of spontaneous bleeding or before invasive procedures
    - Initial management
        - Primary survey - concurrent assessment and resuscitation as needed
        - Haemostatic measures (e.g. pressure)
    - Emergency management - major bleeding
        - Cryoprecipitate - emergency management
            - Contains Factor VIII, Factor XIII, fibronectin, vWF
        - Transexamic acid → stabilises clot formation
            - Analogue of the amino acid lysine → reversibly binds lysine receptors on plasminogen and decreases conversion to plasmin
                - Prevents fibrin degradation
    - Choices in minor bleeding
        - Desmopressin (DDAVP) - used in type 1 vWD
            - Stimulates release of vWF from Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells
        - Recombinant vWF
            - Can be given for patients with severe recurrent bleeding
        - Conjugated oestrogens increase vWF levels (increase clotting factor production)
        - Factor VIII concentrate (monitor as it can cause thrombosis)
- Is vWF patient at risk of spontaneous bleeding (haemarthroses)
    - Prolonged internal haemorrhage (including haemarthrosis) is a feature of secondary haemostasis disorders
        - E.g. Haemophilia A (Factor VIII) or B (IX)
    - vWF classically presents with mucocutaneous bleeding (abnormality of platelet-vessel wall interaction)
        - Still at increased risk as vWF complexes with Factor VIII to transport it in the circulation
- Differentiating between different disorders of haemostasis
    - Interpreting PT and aPTT for bleeding diatheses
        
        
        | PT | aPTT | Interpretation |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Normal | Normal | Isolated platelet pathology (e.g. thrombocytopaenia) |
        | Normal | Prolonged | Defect of intrinsic pathway (VIII, IX, XI, XII - DDx: haemophilia A, B and vWF) [mixing study should be performed]  |
        | Prolonged | Normal | Defect of extrinsic pathway (III, VII, X) - initiate vitamin K challenge |
        | Prolonged | Prolonged | Defect of common pathway (I, II, V, X) or multiple factors in both pathways (supratherapeutic warfarin) |
- Explain the tests of haemostasis (bleeding time, PT, aPTT)
    - Prothrombin time (extrinsic pathway)
        - Time taken to produce fibrin polymers after adding tissue factor (thromboplastin) and calcium
            - Tissue factor expressed by injured endothelial cells which binds VIIa
        - Causes of PT prolongation
            - Anticoagulant therapy
            - Vitamin K deficiency
            - Liver disease
            - DIC
    - Activated partial thromboplastin time (intrinsic)
        - Time taken to produce fibrin polymers after adding phospholipids
            - Formation of activated factor VIII in intrinsic pathway dependent on Ca and phospholipids
        - Causes of aPTT prolongation
            - Anticoagulant therapy
            - Liver disease
            - DIC
            - vWD
            - Inherited deficiency of VIII (haemophilia A), IX (haemophilia B), XI (haemophilia C)
            - Antiphospholipid syndrome
    - Mixing study
        - Patient’s plasma is mixed with normal plasma
            - If the prolonged aPTT is caused by a lack of clotting factors, the factors in the normal plasma will normalise the aPTT
            - If factor inhibitor antibodies present, aPTT will stay prolonged (e.g. lupus anticoagulant)
                - Note: lupus anticoagulant prolongs aPTT in vitro (binds phospholipids needed) but is prothrombotic in vivo (promotes aggregation by binding to platelet phospholipids)
- Normal inhibitors of haemostasis
    - Tissue factor pathway inhibitor - inhibits TF
    - Thrombomodulin
        - Expressed on surface of endothelial cells, monocytes, dendritic cells → converts thrombin to an anticoagulant enzyme
    - Antithrombin III
        - Degrades thrombin and factor Xa, activates tPA
    - Protein C and S
        - S is the cofactor → form activated protein C complex which inhibits Factor Va and VIIIa
            - Vitamin K dependent synthesis (shorter half-life than vitamin K dependent coagulation factors)
            - Factor V Leiden → resistance to Protein C inactivation of Factor V
    - Prostacyclin and NO
        - Secreted by endothelial cells to inhibit platelet aggregation and promote vasodilation
    - Non-specific inhibitors (protease inhibitors in plasma)
- Normal process of fibrinolysis
    - Fibrinolysis is the degradation of the fibrin network by plasmin
    - Tissue injury → release and activation of plasminogen activators (tPA, urokinase, Factor XIa, Factor XIIa)
        - Conversion of plasminogen to plasmin → deactivation and proteolysis of fibrin and fibrinogen → release of fibrin degradation products
- Haemophilia - genetics, pathophysiology
    - Haemophilia - genetic mutations which confer deficiency of one of the clotting factors
        - Haemophilia A (80%) → Factor VIII deficiency
            - X-linked recessive
            - 60% have severe disease
        - Haemophilia B (20%) → Factor IX deficiency
            - X-linked recessive
            - 50% have severe disease
        - Haemophilia C (XI deficiency) is very rare → autosomal recessive
    - Severity of disease based on clinical evidence of haematomas (spontaneous or post-trauma) and activity levels of the relevant factor
    - Recurrent haemoarthroses and deep tissue haematomas is classical symptoms
- DDx for thrombocytopaenia
    - Increased destruction
        - Immune
            - Idiopathic thrombocytopaenia purpura (ITP) - excess phagocytosis
            - Secondary (e.g. SLE)
        - Microangiopathy
            - TTP, HUS, DIC
        - Drug-induced
        - Hypersplenism
    - Decreased production
        - Bone marrow disease
        - Nutritional deficiency
        - Viral infections (HIV, HCV, EBV, CMV)
        - Liver disease
        - Congenital thrombocytopaenia
- ITP
    - Autoimmune disorder where antibodies form against platelet factors
        - Commonly Gp1b (binds vWF) or GpII/IIIb (binds fibrinogen)
    - These platelets covered by IgG are vulnerable to opsonisation and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages and Kupffer cells in the liver
        - Results in premature removal of platelets from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system
- MAHA (general) - pathophysiology
    1. Widespread damage to endothelial cells of the microcirculation
    2. Activation of the coagulation cascade (increased TF present)
    3. Platelet adherence and activation
    4. Excessive thrombosis
        1. End-organ damage
        2. Fragmentation of RBCs (haemolytic anaemia)
        3. Consumption of clotting factors and platelets → severe bleeding
- TTP
    - Deficiency of ADAMTS13 → inadequate breakdown of vWF multimers
        - Accumulation of vWF leads to platelet adhesion and microthrombi formation
        - Fragmentation of RBCs → haemolytic anaemia
- HUS
    - Mostly due to infectious toxins which activate endothelial cells (e.g. Shiga toxin (Shigella dysenteriae) or Shiga-like toxin (enterohaemorrhagic E.coli strain))
- DIC
    - Develops due to activation of pro-coagulant pathways and impairment of physiological anticoagulant pathways
    - Causes
        - Sepsis (especially Gram-negative bacteria)
        - Malignancy - haematological or solid organ tumour (pancreatic, NSCLC, ovarian)
        - Trauma - surgery, crush injuries, rhabdomyolysis, burns, fat embolism
        - Obstetric complications - pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, amniotic fluid embolism
        - Organ failure - ARDS, pancreatitis
        - Toxins - snake bites
- Indications for whole blood and platelet transfusions
    - Whole blood transfusions
        - Rarely used except for massive transfusions (significant blood loss) or elective
    - Packed RBC transfusion
        - Increases O2 carrying capacity in anaemic patients with clinical symptoms and abnormal lab results (indication based on Hb)
            - < 70g/L
            - < ~90g/L with clinical signs or symptoms of impaired O2 transport
        - One infusion increases Hb by ~ 10g/L
    - Platelet transfusions
        - Prophylactic (no bleeding)
            - < 10 x 10^9 (bone marrow suppression or failure)
            - < 50 x 10^9 (surgery, invasive procedures, childbirth)
        - Therapeutic
            - < 20 (minor bleeding)
            - < 50 (massive haemorrhage)
        - Note: platelets not appropriate for ITP in absence of haemorrhage
    - Other products
        - Fresh frozen plasma
            - Cellular components removed → used for clotting factors, multiple factor deficiency, bleeding with abnormal coagulation parameters, major invasive procedures
        - Cryoprecipitate
            - Clotting factors (fibrinogen, Factor VIII, Factor XIII), vWF, fibronectin
        - Clotting factors
        - Antithrombin III
- Principles and techniques of blood grouping and cross-matching whole blood prior to transfusions
    - Blood grouping
        - ABO antibodies fix complement and cause intravascular haemolysis
            - E.g. A blood = A RBC antigen and Anti-B serum antibody
                - Can receive A and O blood
        - Rhesus (transmembrane protein) → Rh D is highly immunogenic
            - Rh - patients from antibodies to D antigen if exposed to D-positive cells (causes severe haemolytic disease of the newborn)
                - Anti D antibodies cause opsonisation but do not fix complement (extravascular haemolysis)
    - Pre-transfusion testing
        - Blood typing
            - ABO and Rh testing of recipient blood
                - Haemagglutination test (RBC clumping induced by specific antibodies for erythrocyte antigens)
            - Compatibility testing (patient serum and prospective donor RNCs)
                - Cross match recipient plasma with potential donor cells (indirect Coombs)
                    - Patient’s serum incubated with test RBCs and then incubated with anti-human antibodies
                        - Antibodies bind to any patient antibodies which reacted to the test RBCs and cause agglutination of the RBCs (positive result)
                - Note direct Coombs (patient RBC and anti-human Ig)
                    - Tests for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
                    - Used to detect antibodies or complement proteins attached to the patient’s own RBCs
                        - Blood sample taken and RBCs washed and incubated with anti-human Ig (Coombs reagent - anti-IgG or anti-C3b)
                            - If red cells agglutinate, the DAT is positive
- Adverse reactions to blood products
    - Immunological
        - Urticaria and anaphylaxis (type 1 hypersensitivity)
        - Acute haemolytic transfusion reaction
            - Due to ABO incompatibility
                - Causes intravascular haemolysis, hypotension, renal failure, DIC
        - Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction
            - Occurs due to production or re-emergence of antibodies
        - Febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reaction
            - Thought to be due to donor leukocytes releasing cytokines (fever, chills, rigors)
    - Non-immunological
        - Infection
        - Volume overload
        - Iron overload
        - Hyperkalaemia
