# Polycythaemia vera

*A 56-year-old man was seen in the Haematology Clinic for review. He was diagnosed with polycythaemia vera six years ago, and had been treated with regular venesections. Over the past few months he had noticed increasing tiredness, early satiety, some weight loss and "discomfort" in the left upper quadrant of his abdomen.*

*Examination revealed a cachectic man with conjunctival pallor. The splenic edge was palpable 10 cm below the costal margin in the mid-clavicular line. The remainder of his examination was normal.*

- What abnormalities may be seen in the bone marrow on aspiration and trephine
    - Early active disease
        - Hypercellularity and hyperplasia of myeloid cell lines

        - Progression to marrow fibrosis
        - Transformation to acute leukaemia
- Polycythaemia vera (general, clinical manifestations, treatment)
    - Neoplastic proliferation of mature myeloid cells (especially RBCs) → platelets and granulocytes are also increased
        - Associated with JAK2 kinase mutations → results in autonomous EPO and TPO receptor stimulation
        - EPO is LOW → negative feedback
            - In reactive polycythaemia, EPO is high as compensation (e.g. in chronic hypoxia)
    - Clinical features
        - Mostly due to **hyperviscosity**
            - **Slow rate of blood flow = poor oxygenation + increased thrombosis risk**
                - Increased risk of venous thrombosis (hepatic vein, portal vein, dural venous sinuses)
                - Blurry vision and headache
            - Facial plethora due to congestion
        - Itching (often after bathing)
            - Due to histamine release from mast cells

    - Symptoms relate to increased risk of bleeding and/or thrombosis
    - Otherwise uncomplicated
        - Rarely progresses to marrow fibrosis or leukaemia
        - No significant gout risk
- What is myelofibrosis? Why does it occur and what are its complications?
    - Myelofibrosis is caused by the proliferation of megakaryocytes which produce excess PDGF (platelet derived growth factor) → marrow fibrosis
    - Types
        - Primary (associated with JAK2 kinase mutations)
        - Secondary to another myeloproliferative disorder (e.g. polycythaemia vera)
    - Complications

            - Splenic infarction as the spleen outgrows its blood supply and thrombosis due to hyperviscosity
        - Leukoerythroblastic smear
        - Bone marrow failure
            - Anaemia, increased infection risk, bleeding and thrombosis
