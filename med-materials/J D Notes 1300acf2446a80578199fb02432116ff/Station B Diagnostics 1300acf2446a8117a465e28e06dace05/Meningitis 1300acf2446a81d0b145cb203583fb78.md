- Risk factors for meningitis
    - Increased risk of infection
        - Overcrowding
        - Sick contacts
        - Smoking or IVDU
        - Immunosuppression
    - Increased risk of infection into intracranial compartment
        - Neurosurgical procedures
        - Recent head trauma
- Common causes in neonates, children and adults
    - Neonates
        - GBS, E. coli, L. monocytogenes
    - Children and adults
        - N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, viral
    - Elderly (>50, immunocompromised)
        - As per adults + L. monocytogenes
- Pathophysiology of meningococcal meningitis
    - Most pathogens which cause meningitis colonise the nasopharynx or the upper airways before entering the CNS through the following routes
        - Haematogenous dissemination (blood-borne)
        - Extension of local infection (e.g otitis media, sinusitis, mastoiditis)
        - Viral invasion via nerves (e.g. retrograde transport)
        - Direct implantation (trauma, iatrogenic (e.g. post-operation))
    - Pathogens need to cross the BBB or meningeal barrier
        - Often at choroid plexus and growth in CSF due to low immune cells and high nutrients
        - Organisms injure barrier cells (increase permeability) or transported by vacuoles
    - Virulence factors which aid infection
        - Adhesins (e.g. pili) to allow bacteria to cling to non-ciliated epithelium
        - IgA protease and polysaccharide capsule to overcome host immune mechanisms
- What is the pathological basis for the meningococcal rash
    - Classic meningococcal rash is non-blanching, petechial
        - Multifactorial but related to the release of cytokines and free radicals with bacteraemia
            - Vasculitis with microthrombi formation
            - Perivascular haemorrhage
            - Suppurative necrosis
- Investigative approach to meningitis
    - URGENT: if bacteraemia due to meningococcus suspected, immediately give ceftriaxone (2g) + dexamethasone before further investigation
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - Lumbar puncture (MCS, glucose, WBC, total protein, PCR)
            - Conduct a CT head before LP if suspicion for SOL (focal signs, raised ICP)
        - Blood cultures (2-3x)
    - Ancillary investigations
        - Bedside
            - Blood gas given signs of shock
            - ECG (risk of type 2 MI)
        - Labs
            - BSL (compare with LP glucose)
                - Normal CSF glucose is 60% of serum glucose
                - In bacterial meningitis, ≤ 25%
            - FBC (thrombocytopaenia - DIC) + WCC
                - Neutrophil predominant = bacterial
                - Lymphocyte predominant = viral
            - CRP
            - Coagulation panel (DIC)
            - UEC, LFT (shock, AKI)
- Interpret the following blood results

    - Toxic granulation
        - Dark coarse granules found in patients with inflammatory conditions (esp. granulocytes like neutrophils)
    - Band neutrophils
        - Intermediary step prior to the complete maturation of segmented neutrophils
            - An increase typically means that the bone marrow has been signalled to release more WBCs or WBC production (left shift)
            - Often due to infection or inflammation
    - Low platelets may suggest DIC
- How is a lumbar puncture performed?
    1. Consent the patient
    2. Position patient in lateral decubitus position with knees tucked to chest for maximal spine flexion
        - Ensure the plane of the back is at exactly 90 degrees to the bed (not leaning towards or away)
        - Mark appropriate spot (below conus medullaris at L1/L2 and termination of spinal cord)
            - Aim for L3/L4 or L4/L5 space
            - A transverse plane between the PSIS correspond approximately to L4
    3. Clean skin with chlorhexadine and place sterile drape over the patient
    4. Inject local anaesthetic (1% lignocaine) subcutaneously and along the track for the needle
    5. Insert needle and aim slightly rostral (towards umbilicus)
        - Layers: skin, fascia, fat, supraspinous or interspinous ligaments, ligamentum flavum
        - Advancing through ligamentum flavum (should feel a ‘give’ afterwards)
            - Epidural space
        - Advance through dura mater (second ‘give’)
    6. Remove stylet and observe for flow of CSF
        - Measure CSF pressure (if relevant)
        - Collect 4 tubes (5-10 drops in each) as numbered
    7. Insert stylet back into needle, withdraw, apply sterile swab and compress puncture site
    8. Bandage and dress patient
    9. Transport samples to laboratory at room temperature 
- Contraindications for LP
    - Infection at puncture site or epidural abscess
    - Increased bleeding risk (e.g. thrombocytopaenia, coagulopathy)
    - Raised ICP = risk of herniation
- Complications of LP
    - Failure to obtain CSF specimen
        - Hence, need to repeat test
    - Post-procedural headache (fairly common: 5-15%)
    - Infectious
        - Spinal epidural abscess
        - Meningitis
    - Neuropathic pain on needle insertion
    - Transient neurological deficits
        - numbness/paraesthesias
        - CNVI palsy (traction due to downward “sagging” of the brain)
    - Tonsillar herniation (extremely rare if no contraindications)
- CSF findings in meningitis

- Mechanism of nuchal rigidity and photophobia
    - Headache (traction on dura mater which is pain sensitive with oedema and inflammation)
    - Nuchal rigidity due to stretch on inflamed nerve roots and meninges in the cervical region
        - Causes protective muscle spasm → neck stiffness. Similar phenomenon elicited in Kernig’s sign
    - Photophobia thought to be due to irritation of the basal meninges around diaphragm sellae
        - “Fear of light → does not want to see”
            - Trigeminal nerve (V1) is important in relaying information from the thalamus to the occipital lobe
            - Meninges is innervated by V1 and can trigger photophobia
        - Abrupt change in light and iris spasm can trigger it
