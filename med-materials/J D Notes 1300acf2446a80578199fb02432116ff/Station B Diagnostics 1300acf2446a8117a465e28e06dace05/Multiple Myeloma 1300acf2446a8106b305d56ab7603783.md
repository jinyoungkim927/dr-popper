# Multiple Myeloma

## Case Protocol 35 – **Multiple Myeloma**

*A 71-year-old woman was found lying on her kitchen floor in severe pain and unable to stand. She was taken to hospital, where examination revealed a thin, distressed woman with shortening and external rotation of her right leg. An X-ray confirmed a fracture of the neck of the femur.*

    - Leukoerythroblastic film
        - Myelofibrosis
        - Multiple myeloma
        - Disseminated metastasis to bone marrow
        - Massive blood loss
        - Disseminated TB
    - Paraprotein
        - Multiple myeloma

        - Malignancy (primary, secondary)
        - Infection (osteomyelitis)
        - Congenital (osteogenesis imperfecta → collagen defect)
- Pathophysiology of multiple myeloma
    - Plasma cell dyscrasias due to an abnormal proliferation of a single clone of plasma cells
        - Multiple myeloma is the most common - due to proliferation of a single terminally differentiated plasma cell line in the bone marrow
        - Often produce immunoglobulin or Ig fragment
            - Known as paraproteins or M protein
            - Most common is IgG excess
        - The deposition of the paraproteins in the body causes organ dysfunction
    - Overall pathogenesis is poorly understood
        - Establishment of a limited stage of asymptomatic proliferation (MGUS)
            - May be due to IgG translocations or hyperdiploidy
        - Progression of MGUS to MM (random not cumulative)
            - e.g. due to genetic lesions (Ras mutations, Myc abnormalities) or bone marrow environment changes (increased angiogenesis, paracrine IL-6 activity)
- Clinical features of multiple myeloma
    - Bony pain (infiltration of bone, osteolytic lesions, spontaneous fractures)
    - Hypercalcaemia
        - Abdominal pain, renal calculi (calcium oxalate), constipation, polyuria, anxiety or depression
    - Renal failure (multifactorial)
    - Bone marrow suppression (pancytopaenia)
        - Anaemia (fatigue, SOBOE), leukopaenia (recurrent infections), thrombocytopaenia (petechiae and/or bleeding)

    - Leukoerythroblastic film (RBC and WBC precursors in peripheral smear) with anaemia and raised ESR
        - Metamyelocytes (WBC precursor) → bent nucleus, cytoplasmic granules, absence of visible nucleoli
        - Nucleated RBCs (precursor)
    - Other findings
        - Pancytopaenia (bone marrow failure and renal failure (reduced EPO))
        - Rouleaux RBCs
            - Flat side of cells adhere and look like a stack of coins
            - Can be seen due to the negated negative charge in myeloma due to the excess positive charge of immunoglobulins
        - ESR elevated due to raised serum proteins negating the negative charge on RBCs are facilitating faster sedimentation
- X-ray abnormalities in myeloma
    - Diffuse, punched-out lesions (often not evident until > 50% bone destruction)
    - Generalised skeletal osteopaenia
    - Plasmacytoma

    - Free monoclonal Ig light chain (kappa or lambda) produced by malignant plasma cell clones
        - Filtered through renal glomeruli due to LMW (found in 80% of MM)
    - Can contribute to renal damage
        - Precipitates in distal nephron and can cause obstruction
        - May be directly toxic to tubules
- Monoclonal bands
    - Finding on SPEP or UPEP which indicates production of a single monoclonal immunoglobulin by a single clone of plasma cells
        - Usually presents as a narrow peak in gamma, beta or a2 regions on densitometer tracing (can be quantified)
        - Found in 90% of MM patients
- Method of electrophoresis and immunofixation
    - Separation of serum proteins by their size and charge
    - Electrophoresis
        - An aliquot of patient’s serum is pipetted into a agarose semi-solid gel matrix and allowed to soak
        - Buffer is added, and a charge is applied to the gel to allow separation of the plasma components by mass and charge
        - The gel is removed and inserted into a cassette where it undergoes staining, washing and drying
            - Normal result
                - Albumin appears as a tight band but other regions appear as a broad smear
            - Abnormal result
                - Presence of a monoclonal band (tight band) indicates the presence of a large quantity of protein with a similar molecular weight
                    - Often in the gamma region - consistent with a monoclonal gammopathy
        - Advantages, disadvantages
            - Allows one to determine the presence and quantity of a paraprotein
            - Not as sensitive to low quantity M protein
            - Cannot determine heavy and light chain class
    - Immunofixation
        - Follow-up investigation
            - The patient’s sample is electrophoresed in at least 5 separate lanes
            - Following electrophoresis, each sample is overlaid with a specific antihuman antibody
                - IgM, IgG, IgA, kappa, lambda
            - Antibody with bind to any paraprotein present which forms a large complex that precipitates out
                - Allows the class of paraprotein to be determined
- Pathophysiology of skeletal lesions in myeloma
    - Abnormal proliferation of plasma cells secrete cytokines (including osteoclast activating factors)
        - Osteoclast action increased (via RANK-L)
        - Osteoblast action inhibited (via DKK cytokines on myeloma cells)
    - Bone resorption outweighs formation
        - Hypercalcaemia, lytic lesions, pathological fractures
- Complications of myeloma
    - Local
        - Bone marrow infiltration → pancytopaenia (anaemia, bleeding risk, immunosuppression)
        - Osteolysis → hypercalcaemia, pathological fractures
    - Systemic
        - Leukopaenia and low levels of functioning Ig
            - Immune dysfunction → increased susceptibility to infections (pneumonia is leading cause of mortality)
        - Renal impairment and AKI (2nd highest cause of mortality)
        - Hyperviscosity syndrome (rare)
        - Spinal cord compression (rare)
        - AL amyloidosis
- Amyloidosis
    - Refers to the extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils of low molecular weight proteins (insoluble)
        - AL amyloidosis (50%) → usually occurs in the context of plasma cel dyscrasias
        - Classically apple-green birefringence on Congo red staining

- Mechanisms of renal injury in myeloma
    - Extent of renal impairment correlates closely with prognosis
    - Tubulointerstitial damage
        - Direct toxic effect of Bence-Jones protein on renal tubules
        - Myeloma cast nephropathy → light chain precipitation obstructs tubules
    - Other secondary causes
        - Hypercalcaemia
            - Diuresis and dehydration, formation of renal calculi
        - Amyloid deposition by lambda light chains

            - Non-IgG M protein
            - Increasing M protein levels over a short period of time
    - No treatment - observation only
- Treatment of myeloma
    - Chemotherapy
        - Induction (reduce number of tumour cells)
        - High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous HCT (when eligible)
        - Maintenance after HCT (chemotherapy)
    - Infection prophylaxis (antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals) due to immunocompromised state
- Predisposition to pneumonia in myeloma patients
    - Immunological factors
        - Hypogammaglobulinaemia (suppression of normal Ig production)

- Myeloma - what to expect on a bone marrow biopsy? What testing can be done on a marrow sample?
    - Microscopy
        - Mature appearing plasma cells (≥ 10%) with basophilic cytoplasm and eccentrically located round nucleus
            - Perinuclear halo (Golgi apparatus)
        - Bone marrow is often hypercellular and diffusely infiltrated
    - Other tests

            - Flow cytometry (determine the cell population by surface CD protein markers)
                - CD56, CD38, CD138
                - CD19 and CD45 **negative**
        - FISH can be used to stage myeloma looking for high-risk chromosomal abnormalities
            - High risk
                - Translocations t(14;16) and t(14;20) [involves IgH locus on chromosome 14]
        - Look for monoclonality of involved:uninvolved free light chain ratio
