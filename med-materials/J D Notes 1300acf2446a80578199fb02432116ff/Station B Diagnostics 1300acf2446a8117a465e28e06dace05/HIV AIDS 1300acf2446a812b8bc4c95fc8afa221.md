# HIV/AIDS

**Case:** *A 35-year-old man was seen in consultation because of progressive wasting, malaise and severe odynophagia for solids and liquids. He reported having unprotected sex with several male partners but had previously avoided screening for HIV.*

*Physical examination revealed a wasted appearance, mild dehydration and a fever of 38.2°C. There were white plaques on the tonsils, palate and tongue. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.*

*Investigations confirmed that he was HIV–positive. His CD4 count was 0.1 x 109/L (reference range 0.5-1.4 x 109/L). A full blood count was also performed (see opposite).*

*OR*

**Past Question:**

*A man presented with a 3-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, a sore throat, malaise and a generalised rash. He is a previous IVDU user.*

            - Sorted proteins are then transferred to the blot in the blotting tack
        - Synthetic antibodies added which bind to specific target proteins
            - Secondary antibody against the first is added, allowing visualisation by colorimetric, chemiluminescence or immunofluorescence
        
        ![paste-10ee71a51bde1b36e4aeca916b918cde904efb1f.jpg](HIV%20AIDS%201300acf2446a812b8bc4c95fc8afa221/paste-10ee71a51bde1b36e4aeca916b918cde904efb1f.jpg)
        
    - ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent immunoassay)
        - Patient serum containing antigens is placed on a surface or in a well
            - Synthetic antibody against the specific antigen is added to the sample with an enzyme linked to it
            - Sample is washed to remove unbound substances
        - A solution containing a substrate against the enzyme is then added which causes a reaction that produces a signal
            - Commonly causes a change in the colour of the sample which can be measured using spectrometry

- Pathophysiology of HIV
    - Cell entry
        - Infection usually through sexual intercourse, perinatal transfer or exposure to infected blood
        - HIV enters body (via mucosal lesions or infection of mucosal immune cells)
            - **Gp120 binds to CD4 receptors** and sequentially binds a **co-receptor**
                - **CCR5** on macrophages in early infection
                - **CXCR4** on T cells in late infection
            - **Exposes the fusogenic domain of gp41 which allows fusion and cell entry**
    - Viral replication
        - RNA genome of HIV is reverse transcribed using **reverse transcriptase** to make HIV dsDNA
            - Incorporated into the host genome by **integrase**
            - **Transcription and translation of viral proteins using host cell machinery**
        - Virions are assembled and **HIV protease** cleaves polyproteins into active proteins
        - **Budding**
            - Virion repurposes a portion of the cell membrane as an envelope and leaves the cell to infect other cells
    - Destruction of cells
        - Increased membrane permeability due to budding of viruses
        - Viral replication interfering with protein synthesis
- Natural history of HIV infection
    - Acute seroconversion
        - Flu-like symptoms (e.g. malaise, fever, rash, generalised lymphadenopathy)
        - Occurs within 2-3 weeks of infection
    - Asymptomatic phase (or chronic)
        - **Increase in CD8 T cells during this phase as they attempt to respond to the virus**
            - **Viral load tends to drop after initial infection**
        - Can last years
    - AIDS
        - Due to loss of functional T cells (< 200 CD4+ T cells = AIDS)
        - Recurrent infections including opportunistic infections

- How does HIV infection lead to a reduced CD4 count
    - HIV selectively infects CD4 helper T cells which may lead to:
        - Increased rates of apoptosis
