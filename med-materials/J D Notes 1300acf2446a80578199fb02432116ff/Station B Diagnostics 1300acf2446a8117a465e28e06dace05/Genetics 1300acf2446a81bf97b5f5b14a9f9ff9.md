## Epilepsy (AR)

3 year old child with epilepsy for epilepsy gene panel, no family history, no pedigree given

## SCID (XR)

Kid who’s 8 months old with SCID (x-linked recessive) and has spent his whole damn life in hosp (poor kid). Now doing some genetic testing via (you wouldn't have guessed it) a gene panel woooooo. Gave you a cheeky stem and pedigree, which basically showed that he was the only kid in the 3 generations who had the disease.

- What are the components of pre-test counselling? Do you need written consent?
    - IPRAC
        - Indications
            - Diagnose a suspected genetic disorder (looking for a gene fault)
            - Determine a cause and appropriate treatment
            - Determine the risk of having a preventable disease

        - Alternatives
            - Manage clinically by symptoms (e.g. epilepsy is a clinical Dx)
            - Counsel around expectations → genetic results give a probability and less certainty
        - Concerns/consent
            - Any test is completely optional = no coercion
            - Requirements for consent are defined by:
                - National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council
                    - Requirements for Human Medical Genome Testing Utilising MPS Technologies
            - Needs written consent
                - Level 1 (standard tests)
                    - Verbal consent is sufficient

- What are the implications of genetic test results for parents and extended family
    - Important to explain sometimes that the test does not give them an answer or find DNA changes which are not yet fully understood
        - Result of VUS
            - May be useful to test other relatives to determine if the gene fault causes the condition
            - Further testing may be warranted in the future
        - Uninformative result
            - Not all gene faults which can cause the genetic condition have been identified
            - Fault may be within a gene which was not tested or unknown
    - Clinically significant findings
        - Likelihood of them developing the disease
            - Therapies may be able to prevent or slow disease progression
        - Carrier status
            - Does not cause health problems in the patient
            - Reproductive implications
                - Pre-conception and pregnancy counselling and testing
- What are the types of genetic variants and significance
    - Variant classes
        - **Pathogenic (V)**
            - 99% likely to be causative
        - **Likely pathogenic (IV)**
            - 90% likely to be disease causing
        - Variant of uncertain significance (III)
            - Cannot be classified as either benign or pathogenic based on currently available evidence
        - Likely benign (II)
            - 90% likely to be benign
        - Benign (I)
            - 99% likely to be benign
    - **Note: for an AR condition, requires TWO variants which are Class IV or higher**
- What should be included in post-test genetic counselling
    - Initial
        - **Emotional impact on the patient and others involved**
        - Interpretation of test results (outline any ambiguous results)
        - Explain test reliability and need for further testing if required
        - Description of disease (symptoms, natural history, prevention, treatment, risk to future generations)
    - Implications
        - Privacy and confidentiality of the results (who should results be disclosed to?)
        - Impact of results on patients and relatives
            - Strategy to inform relatives should be discussed
    - Provide:
        - Written material to help patient share information with family
        - Written summary of the test result + issues discussed in consult
        - Offer follow-up sessions or psychology support
- Who would have access to a patient’s genetic test results (beyond themselves)
    - Patients can choose to be informed or not informed about incidental findings:
        - Any genetic conditions
        - Conditions which can be treated or prevented
        - Genetic carrier status
    - Results will be reported to the doctor and be in the medical record
    - For patients making a decision for a minor
        - Genetic Alliance Australia recommends that parents only test the children for conditions or genetic carrier status **WHEN the result is likely to directly benefit the child’s health during childhood**
    - DNA results would only be used for purposes where you have given explicit consent or when it is lawfully required
        - Test result is not revealed to others not involved in your care unless written consent is given

- What information is needed from the FHx to produce a genetic pedigree
    - FHx should include information on ≥ 3 generations
        - Start by listing all members of the family first
    - Questions should include:
        - General information (names, birthdates)
        - Family’s origin or ethnic background
        - Health status (medical conditions, ages at diagnosis)
        - Age of death and cause
        - Pregnancy outcomes of the patient and genetically-related relatives
        - Consanguinity
- Pedigree - key features
    - Symbols

    - De novo
        - New spontaneous variant
- What is a proband and consultand
    - Proband
        - Person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family
        - “Patient” during the genetics consultation
    - Consultand
        - Person who presents for genetic counselling (does not need to be proband)
- Clinical genetics – define the following terms: co-dominance, variable expression, incomplete penetrance, pleiotropy, anticipation, mosaicism
    - Co-dominance
        - Both alleles contribute to the phenotype of the heterozygote (e.g. AB blood group)
    - Variable expression
        - Patients with the same genotype but different phenotypes (i.e. varying disease severity)
    - Incomplete penetrance
        - Not all patients with the variant genotype have the variant phenotype
        - BRCA does not always result in breast cancer
    - Pleiotropy
        - One gene contributes to multiple phenotypic effects
    - Mosaicism
        - Presence of genetically distinct cell lines in the same individual
- What is cascade screening in relation to genetic testing
    - A systematic process for the identification of individuals at risk for a hereditary condition
        - Begins with the identification of an individual with the condition and/or a pathogenic variant associated with the condition
        - Extends genetic testing to his or her at-risk biological relatives
    - Process is repeated as more affected individuals or pathogenic variant carriers are identified
- X-linked recessive condition. No other family member affected except one boy. Who else would you test?
    - Test the mother to see if she is a carrier or the child has new pathogenic variant
    - If the mother is positive, test the mother’s mother (ie. grandmother) to see if she is a carrier
        - If the grandmother is positive, then we can proceed to test aunts (mother’s sisters)
        - If the grandmother is negative, then it might be a new somatic/pathogenic variant/mutation that occurred at the level of the mother
            - Aunts may not need to be tested
    - If it is a X-linked recessive disease, men in the family does not need to be tested as they will be symptomatic if affected.
- Types of genetic alterations (e.g. SNV, indel, CNV, triple repeat)
    - Single nucleotide variant (SNV)
        - **Substitutional of the single nucleotide for another**
        - Silent change (synonymous)
            - **SNV which does not change the amino acid (due to codon redundancy)**
                - Multiple codons can code the same AA
            - May still cause disease through impacting splicing
        - Missense change (non-synonymous)
            - SNV which results in a change in the amino acid produced
        - Nonsense change (stop)
            - SNV which results in a stop codon → truncation of protein which is non-functional
    - Insertion or deletion
        - Frameshift mutation
            - If the insertion or deletion is not a multiple of three, it will change the reading frame of all the remaining bases resulting in drastic changes
    - Copy number variation
        - Duplication or deletion which changes the number of copies of a particular DNA segment in the genome
    - Triplet repeat expansion
        - Increase in the number of repeats of a codon (e.g. Fragile X, Huntington)

            - Some locations of pathogenic variants (e.g. splice enhancers or silencing sequences) are not currently detected
    - Expensive (WGS > WES)
    - Incidental findings can cause unnecessary investigations and patient distress
    - A genetic diagnosis does not always relate to how a person is, or will be, affected by that condition (heterogeneity, variable expression, incomplete penetrance)
    - Higher change of VUS
    - Slow turn-around (months)
- What is WES? Benefits? Limitations of WES v WGS
    - WES codes the exons (protein-coding regions) of the genome along with a limited number of bases on either side of each exon-intron boundary
        - Amounts for around 1% of the entire genome
    - Pros
        - Comprehensive

        - Part of an exon which may contain a pathogenic variant
    - Used in patients with a specific presentation which only a few or single genes can cause (e.g. SMA, DMD, Huntingtons)
    - Benefits
        - Very fast and cheap
        - ≥ 99% accuracy
        - Less variants of VUS

    - Benefits
        - Minimises the chance of pathogenic variants being missed in more difficult to sequence regions
        - **Lowers the chance of incidental findings**
        - Cheaper than WES
    - Limitation
        - May miss variants if the gene which they are located has not been pre-specified
        - Limited detection of:
            - CNVs
            - Structural variants
            - Intrionic variants
- What is a virtual gene panel
    - A way of analysing only the parts of whole exome and whole genome sequencing data which are thought to be relevant to the clinical presentation

- What is the approach to diagnosing a suspected genetic disorder with a non-specific phenotype
    - Initial
        - FHx + clinical manifestations + general Ix
    - If organ specific → gene panel
    - If multi-systemic → chromosomal microarray
    - If either gene panel or microarray return negative, proceed to WES or WGS
