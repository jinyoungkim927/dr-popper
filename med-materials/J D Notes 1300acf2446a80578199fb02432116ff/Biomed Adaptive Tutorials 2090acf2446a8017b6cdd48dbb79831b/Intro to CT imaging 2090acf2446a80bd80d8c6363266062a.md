# Intro to CT imaging

## Intro:

- CT scanner repeated 360° rotations around px
- get multiple 2D/cross-sect. XR images
- each rotation prod. sinogram
- sinogram represents all XRs performed
- using comp algorithms sinograms reconstructed into 3D structures as CT images/slices of various planes
- reconstruction allows image construction in diff planes, windows and sequences in time

### CT Planes:

1. axial 
2. sagittal 
3. coronal

### Interpreting shades of grey:

- diff shades = diff tissue density
- grey shade spectrum/tissue density meausred in Hounsfield units
- air (black) → water (grey) → metal (white)
- windows = limited ranges used to visualise tissues
- 3 main windows = Lung, Soft tissue, Bone

### Contrast:

helps tissue differentiation + interpretation (w/in same window)

IV contrast timed w/ scanning to give best info

phases = timing can synchronise w/ arterial, venous or portal flow

common phases for CT abdo = arterial and portal venous phase

### Contrast risks and risk reduction:

IV contrast nephrotoxic → contrast-induced nephropathy → temp/perm renal impairment

- if pre-existing renal impairment → consider pros v. cons
- reduce RFs for contrast-induced nephropathy
- where appropriate every px should receive:
    - 1mL/kg/hr normal saline IV over 12h pre contrast administration
    - N-acetylcysteine 600mg PO BD on day before and after elective CT scan day
    - check serum creatinine on day after scan

allergy hx imp. ; contrast allergy presents as: 

- low risk: nausea, flushing, headaches
- moderate risk: vomiting, urticaria
- high risk: brconhospasm, facial/laryngeal oedema

### Radiation and its effects:

- diff units to measure diff radiations
    - radiation exposed to skin ⇒ ***Grays (Gy)***
    - radiation absorbed by body ⇒ ***Sieverts*** ***(Sv)***
    
    ![comparing radiation exposure; 1d exposure = 6 microSieverts of radiation](Intro%20to%20CT%20imaging%202090acf2446a80bd80d8c6363266062a/Screenshot_2025-06-05_at_5.42.41_PM.png)
    
    comparing radiation exposure; 1d exposure = 6 microSieverts of radiation
    
- Level of danger of radiation exposure depends on:
    1. Site
    2. Scan type
    3. Age 
- Acute effects:
    
    @ 2Gy = skin redness, ulceration, hair loss, skin necrosis
    
    @ 2-6Gy = sterility
    
    Cataracts 
    
- Long term effects ⇒ cancer risk

### Reducing radiation exposure:

1. select appropriate test 
2. lead shielding (PPE + lead-lined room)
3. increase distance b/w CT scanner and staff
4. using PO/IV contrast 
5. minimise repeated imaging 

## Cases

## Case 1

A 40 year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of severe shortness of breath. She complains of pleuritic chest pain. Her recent history includes a plane trip from China. She is on the oral contraceptive pill, does not smoke and is a social drinker.

She looks unwell and is gasping for breath when you examine her.

Her trachea is midline, but her breathing is shallow.

You notice that her left leg is more swollen than her right, and is red and swollen.

Her oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, which increases to 95% on a 6L Hudson mask.

- What is your PDx?
    
    most likely DVT 
    
    RF = long distance travel.
    
    Emboli from DVT travel via the venous circulation to the R) side of heart → lodge in pulmonary arterial branches that match their size
    
    The correct answer is: Venous thromboembolism
    

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with DVT and possible pulmonary embolism.

[Please refer to the link below for more info on **pulmonary embolism**: [http://radiopaedia.org/articles/pulmonary-embolism](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/pulmonary-embolism)]

The decision is made to request a CT pulmonary angiogram to assess whether there are emboli in the pulmonary vasculature. This involves the injection of contrast to distinguish between venous and arterial circulations, and to visualise emboli.

- What do we need to consider prior to a CT with intravenous contrast?
    
    The correct answers are: Pregnancy, Renal function, Medication history, Allergy history
    
    **Pregnancy:** A pregnancy test is important for all females of child-bearing age to prevent any radiation exposure to an embryo/fetus.
    
    **Renal function:** The procedure involves the use of IV contrast. While a CT pulmonary angiogram is the gold standard to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, the risk may outweigh the benefits if the patient has impaired renal function.
    
    **Medication history:** It is important to ask about medications as IV contrast should not be administered if the patient is on metformin unless in an emergency case (to prevent renal impairment).
    
    **Allergy history:** A previous history of allergic reactions to iodine (as in the contrast) must be considered.

## Case 2

A 75 year-old man, who is a retired construction worker, presents with a history of increasing shortness of breath and fatigue over the past five months.

A CT scan of the chest was requested.

## Case 3

An 84 year-old man presents to the Emergency Department within 1 hour of his family noticing the following abnormalities:

1. Left-sided facial droop, slurred speech

2. Dropping his fork and knife during dinner

3. Inability to coordinate walking when getting out of the chair.

His past medical history includes:

- Ischaemic heart disease
- Hypertension
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

- What is your PDx?
    
    hx most consistent w/ Stroke/TIA
    

The attending physician for the 84 year-old man with sudden onset of facial weakness and incoordination requested an urgent non-contrast CT Brain to determine whether it was a haemorrhagic stroke or an ischaemic stroke.

Note the difference between this slice and the previous one.

## Case 4

A 21 year-old man is involved in a motor vehicle accident. In the Emergency Department, you observe multiple abrasions and lacerations, both on his face and scalp. His speech is incomprehensible, he does not open his eyes to painful stimuli, and only the right side of his body withdraws to pain.

A non-contrast CT scan is requested.

## Case 5

A 74 year-old man presents to the Emergency Department (ED) with worsening left loin pain and associated left upper quadrant abdominal pain. The pain started that morning. He also noticed blood in his urine.

The patient had stopped his warfarin in anticipation of an elective hernia repair. He is on warfarin to prevent cardiac mural thrombosis and embolism due to atrial fibrillation. He has been eating normally, albeit with more vegetables than usual since his daughter moved in with him.

His other medical conditions include type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

Medication history:

Warfarin (INR unknown)Digoxin 125 mcg in the morningGlicazide 60 mg twice a dayAmlodipine 5 mg in the morning

The patient's INR (checked in ED) was 1.0 and his ECG showed he was in atrial fibrillation. He was therefore at high risk of developing a mural thrombus which could embolise, e.g to the renal vessels.

The patient's condition indicates that he needs imaging of his abdomen.

The decision is made to proceed with an abdominal CT with IV contrast.

A pre-CT checklist shows the following:

1. Slightly elevated creatinine, but stable to perform CT with contrast

2. Requires an IV cannula with prehydration

3. Not on metformin though a diabetic

4. No allergies or contraindication to administration of contrast

5. Understands the procedure

**This is an axial slice from the patient's abdominal CT scan. It shows the soft tissue window, in the arterial phase.**

[Please refer to the link below for more info on renal infarction: [http://radiopaedia.org/articles/renal-infarction](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/renal-infarction)]

**You also decide to examine a coronal slice of the patient's abdominal scan.**

**Again, it shows the soft tissue window, in the arterial phase.**
