    - Explain the sequence of steps required for microscopic examination of an anatomical pathology specimen
        - **Blocking**
            - Cannot microscopically analyze all the tissue so must useÂ **representative samples**
            - e.g. for appendix tip (carcinoid and first location of inflammation; base for excision margin)
        - **Processing**
            - Dehydration
                - Replace water with alcohol
            - Clearing
                - Replace alcohol with xylol
            - Paraffin infiltration
                - Replace xylol with paraffin
        - **Embedding**
            - The irregular piece of waxy tissue is laid flat and surrounded by a firm border of wax for support
        - **Microtomy**
            - Thin 4 micrometer slices are made using a microtome
            - Floated on water to remove wrinkles
            - Placed onto a slide
        - **Staining**
            - Haematoxylin and Eosin stain is the routine stain for delineation of tissue constituent
                - Cellular details, extracellular matrix and stroma
        - **Diagnosis and additional tests**
            - Histochemical stains (chemical reactions with different tissue elements e.g. Prussian blue for iron)
            - Immunohistochemical stains (antibodies against particular epitopes e.g. Ki-67 in pituitary adenomas)
    - Why is formalin needed in anatomical pathology
        - Formalin is a neutral buffered solution of formaldehyde used as a fixative
            - Chemical reaction between formaldehyde and proteins which forms semi-permanent cross links between amino acids
        - Useful to:
            - Arrest decomposition (autolysis)
            - Preserve cellular architecture and components
