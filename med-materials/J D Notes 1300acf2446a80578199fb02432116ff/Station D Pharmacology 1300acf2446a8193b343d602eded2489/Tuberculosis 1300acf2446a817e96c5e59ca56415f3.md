# Tuberculosis

***Case:** 40yo immigrant presents to clinic with 3-week history of productive cough, haemoptysis, SOB
and pleuritic chest pain, associated with a low-grade fever, night sweats and weight loss. Respiratory
examination was unremarkable, but palpation revealed lymphadenopathy.*

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: Tuberculosis
        - Classic symptomatic presenting in progressive-primary TB or secondary TB with pulmonary lesions
            - Chronic cough, haemoptysis, anorexia or weight loss, fever, night sweats, malaise
        - Note that primary TB or latent TB are largely asymptomatic
    - DDx for chronic cough + constitutional symptoms
        - Lung malignancy
            - Primary lung cancer
            - Metastatic lung cancer
            - Lymphoma with B symptoms
        - Infectious - pneumonia, lung abscess, AECOPD or AE of asthma
        - Autoimmune - sarcoidoisis, vasculitis
        - Septic embolism to the lung
- What are the various clinical types of TB (e.g. primary, post-primary, extrapulmonary)
    - Primary TB
        - Active disease
            - Any disease with signs and symptoms
            - May be ‘progressive’ in immunocompromised individuals (progressive lung disease, bacteraemia, miliary TB)
        - Latent TB
            - 95% develop latent disease after initial exposure
            - Risk of reactivation is 5-10% across a lifetime
    - Secondary (post-primary TB)
        - Reactivation is often due to immune suppression
        - Typically manifests as cavitating lesions
    - Extrapulmonary TB
        - Can affect any organ
        - Miliary TB → disseminated disease with multi-organ involvement
        - Most likely in immunocompromised patients
- What is the natural history of TB?
    - Primary infection
        - Exposure (often respirator droplets) reach terminal alveoli and taken up by macrophages in alveoli
            - M. tuberculosis able to replicate within macrophages and evade pathocytic response
            - Subclinical bacteraemia and cellular immune response leads to granuloma formation and localised caseous necrosis
        - Outcomes
            - Sufficient immune response (95% of people)
                - Most bacteria killed, some remain in granulomas
                    - Ghon focus = granuloma in lung
                    - Ghon complex = focus + regional lymph nodes
            - Progressive primary TB
                - Inadequate host response → satellite lesions (extra-pulmonary) and progressive lung disease
                - Potential for massive haematogenous spread
            - Massive haematogenous spread
                - Miliary TB with minimal caseation due to complete inadequacy of the immune response
    - Healing and latency
        - In most individuals, MTB is never completed eradicated and the disease enters a latent stage with viable organisms residing inside macrophages
    - Post-primary TB
        - Reactivation (e.g. immunosuppression, reinfection) leads to further disease (clinical TB)
            - Large caseous lesions in the lungs and granulomatous inflammation (prior sensitisation leads to a stronger inflammatory response with extensive tissue destruction, cavitation and scarring)
        - Can become ‘progressive’ with bronchogenic spread and haematogenous dissemination

- What do TB granulomas look like histologically
    - Epithelioid histiocytes (macrophages) surrounding an area of central caseous necrosis
        - Some macrophages fuse to form giant cells (Langhans giant cells)
        - Necrosis due to release of cytotoxic enzymes and lipids of dead mycobacteria
- Where does reactivation of TB occur in the lungs?
    - Post-primary TB most often occurs in the lung apices or superior segment of lower lobes
        - Oxygen tension is highest at these regions
            - V/Q ratio is highest at the apices and lowest at the bases (as higher ventilation and perfusion at bases)
            - May also have poor lymphatic flow and poor organism clearance
        - MTB is a strict aerobe and tends to flourish at the lung apices
- What is your investigative approach to active TB?
    - **Diagnosis of active TB suggested by clinical examination (or high-risk patient) and supported by microbiology or radiology**
    - Sample collection
        - Sputum samples (x3) - one in early morning and take 8h apart
    - Microbiology
        - PCR of sample (e.g. sputum)
            - Rapid differentiation of MTB and non-tuberculous strains
            - Enables identification of drug-resistance
        - Microscopy with acid-fast stain (Ziehl-Neelsen)
        - Culture and susceptibility (Lowenstein-Jensen media) is gold standard however takes 4-6 weeks for growth
    - Radiological
        - CXR or CT chest
            - Primary TB: hilar lymphadenopathy, Ghon complex, consolidation, cavitation (primary progressive)
            - Calcified lesions
    - Ancillary
        - Labs
            - FBC (WCC, platelets)
            - CRP or ESR
            - UECs, LFTs, CMP
            - BBV testing (**HIV**, HBV, HCV)
- How do you screen for latent TB
    - Indications
        - High risk TB exposure (close contact, endemic countries)
        - High risk of reactivation (HIV, recent infection, IVDU, immunosuppressants)
    - Tuberculin skin test (PPD, Mantoux)
        - Injection of TB purified protein derivative into patient’s skin and interpret result within 48-72h
            - Active or latent TB indicated by erythema and induration at the injection site
                - Caused by delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction (T-cell or macrophage infilatraion of site
            - Measure transverse diameter of induration
                - ≥ 15mm is positive for immunocompetent patients
                - ≥ 10 mm for high risk patients
        - False positives with BCG vaccination or non-tuberculous mycobacterium
            - Can be falsely negative in early infection or immunocompromised
    - Interferon-y release assay (IGRA) → highly specific (FN possible)
        - Tests cell-mediated immunity against MTB through measuring amount of IFN-y release by T cells
            - Measured through ELISA (coat blood in tubes with antigens and measure response)
        - Unaffected by BCG vaccine
- Microbiology of M. tuberculosis
    - Acid-fast bacilli
    - No Gram stain due to high mycolic acid content in cell wall
    - Strict aerobes
    - Non-motile

- What is Ziehl-Neelsen staining? How is it performed? How does M. tuberculosis look?
    - Method
        - Sample is heated (enables dye to infiltrate lipid wall) and stained with carbon-fuchsia
        - Decolourised with a mixture of 3% HCl in 95% ethanol
            - Primary dye is not lost due to high lipid content in cell wall
        - Counter stain with methylene blue
    - Interpretation
        - Acid-fast bacilli appear pink on Z-N stain (retention of carbon-fuchsia)
        - Identification of a single AFB is diagnostic and indication to commence treatment
- Management approach to TB?
    - Non-pharmacological
        - Notifiable disease → notify state PHUs
        - Contact tracing by specially trained personnel
        - Isolation with airborne precautions
            - Note that patient is non-infectious (if drug susceptible) within 2 weeks of treatment
        - Patient education
        - Direct observed therapy to improve compliance
    - Pharmacological
        - Standard short-course therapy for active TB
            - Suitable for susceptible, compliant, no evidence of miliary or CNS TB
            - Intensive phase → 2 months of RIPE
                - Rifampicin **(rifubatin for HIV)**, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol
            - Continuation therapy
                - 4 months of rifampicin and isoniazid
                - **Can extend up to 9 months if HIV or meningitis**
        - Latent TB
            - Yearly CXR follow-up or monotherapy (rifampicin 4 months, isoniazid 9 months)
- Management of multi-drug resistant TB?
    - Multi-drug resistant TB = resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin (at least)
        - Test for rifampicin resistance (PCR) if MDRTB suspected
        - High risk patients include close contacts, patients with previous treatment failure, or patients from high-risk endemic areas (China, SE Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa)
    - Treatment under specialist supervision with second-line agents and a longer course (18-24 months)
        - Aminoglycosides (e.g. streptomycin)
        - Fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin)
        - Cycloserine
            - Mechanism
                - Alanine analogue which inhibits peptidoglycan cross-linking and inhibit early synthesising enzymes
            - AEs: neurological and psychologic effects (dose-dependent)
- Pharmacology of TB
    - Rifampicin
        - Mechanism
            - Inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and prevents transcription and protein synthesis
                - Rifabutin preferred for HIV patients on antiretrovirals due to less CYP450 induction
        - AEs
            - Hepatotoxicity
            - Discolouration of body fluids (orange)
            - CYP induction → drug interactions
            - Rash, fever, GI intolerance
    - Isoniazid
        - Mechanism
            - Pro-drug activated by mycobacterial enzymes which blocks fatty acid synthesis
                - Inhibits formation of the mycolic acid cell wall
        - AEs
            - Hepatotoxicity
            - Drug-induced lupus
            - B6 deficiency (peripheral neuropathy) **→ give with supplement pyridoxine (B6)**
            - CNS toxicity, psychosis
    - Pyrazinamide
        - Mechanism
            - Converted to pyrazinoic acid by mycobacterial pyrazinamidase which may interfere with cell membrane transport, fatty acid synthesis, protein synthesis
        - AEs
            - Hepatoxicity
            - Hyperuricaemia
            - GI upset

        - Mechanism
            - Inhibits cell wall synthesis by blocking arabinosyl transferase (important component of cell wall)
        - AEs
            - Optic neuritis
            - Peripheral neuropathy
            - GI upset
