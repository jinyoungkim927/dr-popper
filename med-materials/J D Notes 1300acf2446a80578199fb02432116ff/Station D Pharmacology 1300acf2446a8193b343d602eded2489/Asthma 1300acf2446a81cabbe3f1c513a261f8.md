# Asthma

## Case Protocol 39 – **Asthma**

**Case:**

*A 35-year-old woman was seen by her local doctor because of increasing dyspnoea over the previous 12 hours. She had suffered from asthma since childhood, requiring numerous hospital admissions, and consequently was reluctant to consult doctors or to go to hospital. Her only medication was a salbutamol puffer, used as required. She had been suffering from an upper respiratory tract infection for the past three days and had a cough productive of yellow sputum.*

*On examination, the woman was dyspnoeic at rest, having difficulty in carrying out a conversation. She was pale but not cyanosed, the chest was hyperinflated with prominent tracheal tug, and she was using accessory muscles of respiration. Bilateral inspiratory and expiratory wheezes were heard on auscultation. She was commenced on antibiotics, nebulised salbutamol and prednisone tablets, but refused admission to hospital.*

            - Has it woken you up at night?
            - How bad are your early-morning symptoms
        - How often have you needed your reliever?

            - Cough
            - Wheeze
            - Dyspnoea

                    - **FEV1 must improve by 12% or 200mL**
                - Bronchoprovocation testing
                    - Attempt to induce bronchoconstriction with methacholine (dose lowered than that which would cause bronchoconstriction in a typical patient)
                        - Assess for airway hypersensitivity and reactivity
                        - If FEV1 decreases by 15% → asthma
                    - Safety measures (resuscitation) must be available
- Interpret this ABG (asthma)

    - Low pH - acidosis
        - Low O2 - hypoxaemia
        - High PaCO2 - hypercapnia (inadequate alveolar ventilation)
        - Normal HCO3 (no metabolic compensation)
    - Consistent with acute type 2 respiratory failure and uncompensated respiratory acidosis
- Definition and pathophysiology of asthma
    - Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, with a variable clinical story that may include dyspnoea, wheeze, chest tightness and cough
        - Associated with variable, partially reversible airway limitation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness
    - Pathophysiology
        - Heterogenous and incompletely understood
            - Many cases are related to atopy (type 1 hypersensivity) however others are not (e.g. occupational exposures, pharmacological - aspirin)
                - Most common atopic pattern is **eosinophilic with Th2 cell recruitment** (also neutrophilic, mixed inflammatory, pauci-granulocytic)
        - Common pathophysiological pathways
            - Functional abnormalities
                - Variable, reversible increase in airway resistance (bronchoconstriction, mucus plugging, airway oedema)
                - Airway hyperresponsiveness
            - Airway inflammation
                - Vascular congestion
                - Cellular infiltrate (eosinophils or neutrophils)
            - **Airway remodelling - long term pathological changes**
                - Bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia
                - Goblet cell hyperplasia
                - Subepithelial collagen accumulation
                - Increased vascularity
- Autopsy findings in asthma
    - Macroscopic
        - Hyperinflation of lungs (secondary to air-trapping from obstruction)
        - Mucous plugs in bronchi/bronchioles
        - Areas of collapse/atelectasis
        - Areas of pneumonic consolidation
    - Microscopic
        - **Acute asthma: bronchial and bronchiolar inflammation**
            - Vascular congestion
            - Cellular infiltrate
        - **Chronic asthma: airway remodelling**
            - Bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia
            - Goblet cell hyperplasia
            - Subepithelial collagen accumulation
            - Increased vascularity
        - Other features
            - Curschmann spirals (whorls of shed epithelium in mucous plugs)
            - Charcot-Leyden crystals (eosinophilic needle-like crystals due to breakdown of eosinophils)
- Treatment paradigm for long-term prevention
    - A stepwise approach is taken to treat asthma long-term
        - Aim for good symptom control with the lowest possible dose of medication
    - Escalate treatment after 1-3 months if good control is not achieved
        - Consider other factors if poor response:
            - Inhaler technique
            - Adherence
            - If symptoms are related to asthma or alternate diagnosis
    - Steps
        - Step 1: PRN reliever (SABA)
        - Step 2: Low dose ICS + PRN SABA
        - Step 3: ICS + LABA combination (low dose) + PRN SABA
        - Step 4: ICS + LABA (medium to high dose) + PRN SABA
        - Step 5: consider specialist referral for additional treatments (e.g. immunotherapy)
