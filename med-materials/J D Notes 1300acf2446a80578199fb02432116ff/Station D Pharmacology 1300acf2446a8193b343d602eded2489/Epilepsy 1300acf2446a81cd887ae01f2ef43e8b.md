# Epilepsy

*A 52-year-old tradesman who **drives a van** presents to your practice with **visual changes**. He suffered from **seizures in the past 6 months** and was thus on **400mg BD of carbamazepine.** He began to experience **diplopia one hour after his morning dose**. Serum levels reveal that he is in the **upper limit of normal ranges for carbamazepine**.*

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx
        - Diplopia may represent a side effect of his carbamazepine (due to impairment of the extra-ocular muscles, as a result of Na+ channel blockage)
        - Other causes of sudden onset diplopia include
            - Vascular (infarction, aneurysm), demyelinating (MS), neoplastic (tumour/mass), infective processes affecting orbit, extraocular muscles, neurological structures
    - Causes of reduced seizure threshold in an epileptic
        - Poor sleep
        - Psychosocial stress
        - Systemic infection
    - DDx for seizures
        - Organic causes
            - Cerebrovascular

                - Hypocalcaemia
                - Hypomagnasaemia
            - Drugs or toxicity
                - Uraemia
                - Intoxication
                - Alcohol or BZD withdrawal
        - Seizure mimics
            - Syncope (convulsive)
            - TIA
            - Transient global amnesia
            - Vestibular pathologies → drop attacks
        - Other
            - Psychiatric disorders (psychogenic non-epileptic seizure)
            - Delirium
            - REM sleep disorder
- Define seizure
    - Excessive and/or uncoordinated activity of cortical neurons resulting in transient neurological sxs
    - May be focal (aware, impaired awareness) or generalised, motor or non-motor
- Define epilepsy
    - Chronic neurological disorder characterised by a predisposition to experience recurrent seizures and is define by one of the following
        - At least 2 unprovoked or reflex seizures occurring >24h apart
        - 1 unprovoked or reflex seizure and an increased risk of recurrence (i.e. a recurrence risk similar to those have had 2 unprovoked seizures) occurring over the next 10y
            - E.g. after a first unprovoked seizure, the risk of a subsequent seizure is 50%. After a second seizure, the risk of another seizure is 70%
        - Dx of an epilepsy syndrome
    - Can be a 1’ problem (idiopathic) or a Sx of another brain disorder (genetic or structual lesion, e.g. post-TBI, stroke, SOL, congenital - cortical dysgenesis)
    - ~50% don’t experience another seizure after their first, and hence do not have epilepsy

    4. Special syndromes
        - febrile seizures
        - isolated seizures/status epilepticus
        - metabolic and toxin-induced seizures
- What is your investigative approach to case (diplopia + carbamazepine) and seizures
    - Specific to case
        - Serum carbamazepine level → identify risk of toxicity (ataxia, diplopia, nystagmus) which may begin above 10mg/L.
            - Critical level (risk of sedation) is 30-40mg/L.
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - Epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis (history predominant)
            - Investigations support the diagnosis and help identify causes whilst excluding mimics
    - Ancillary investigations
        - Bedside
            - ECG → syncope
            - EEG → supports diagnosis (not indicated acutely), may be video EEG
        - Labs
            - FBC → leukocytosis in infection
            - BSL
            - UEC or CMP

            - Infectious (CNS infection - fever, nuchal rigidity, headache, raised ICP)
            - Trauma
            - Autoimmune
            - Metabolic (electrolyte disturbances, encephalopathy)
            - Iatrogenic or drugs (alcohol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, barbiturate withdrawal)

        - Previous side effects or toxicity
        - Compliance and reasons for non-compliance
        - Most recent dose? Amount?
    - Social → risk factors for seizures
        - Alcohol
        - Drug use
        - Stress
        - Sleep deprivation
        - Driving (should not drive in the 12 months following a seizure)
- Epilepsy - management paradigm + first-line agents
    - Aim of pharmacotherapy is to suppress seizures whilst minimising side effects
        - Decision to treat depends on patient factors (e.g. employment, hobbies, driving) and disease factors (e.g. severity and frequency of seizures)
    - Initial management
        - Treat underlying cause if possible (e.g. brain tumour)
        - First-line pharmacological agents
            - Focal seizures → carbamazepine
            - Generalised seizures → sodium valproate
            - Uncertain → sodium valproate, levetiracetam
    - Refractory epilepsy
        - If seizures are not controlled by monotherapy
            - Second antiepileptic drug
                - Can withdraw first drug to consider monotherapy
                - Can substitute either drug for a third agent
            - Withdrawal of drugs should be gradual, ≥ 6 weeks (drug dependent), due to seizure risk
        - If seizures are still uncontrolled on dual therapy (1/3 of patients)
            - Consider reasons for failure (wrong diagnosis, poor compliance)
            - Specialist referral (video-EEG)
            - Surgery (e.g. temporal lobectomy)
    - Note: valproate should be avoided in women of child-bearing age (teratogenic)
        - Lamotrigine is a suitable alternative in many cases
        - Levetiracetam may also be suitable
- Carbamazepine → MoA, AEs, drug interactions
    - Use: first-line in focal seizures with efficacy for other seizure types
    - Mechanism
        - Decreases neuronal excitability by inhibiting voltage- and use-dependent Na+ channels
            - Increased GABA mediated transmission → Cl influx → hyperpolarisation of neurons → prevention of repetitive neuronal discharges
    - Side effects (SAD HINT+)
        - SIADH
        - Agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia
        - Diplopia, blurred vision, nystagmus
        - Hepatotoxicity
        - Induction of CYP450 enzymes
        - Nausea, constipation, vomiting
        - Teratogenic
        - + Others
            - GIT intolerance
            - Rash and risk of SJS
            - Headache
    - Interactions
        - CYP450 inducer → accelerates metabolism of many drugs (e.g. warfarin, macrolides)
    - Monitoring (regular blood levels - 3, 6, 9 weeks initially)
- Carbamazepine induces hepatic enzymes - how would this affect drug dosing and initiation
    - Carbamazepine may result in an elevation of hepatic enzymes
        - Not likely due to hepatic injury but the drug induces an increased production of these enzymes
    - Due to auto-induction of CYP450 enzymes, the half-life of carbamazepine actually drops with time
        - The half-life is normally 36h but when given repeatedly, the induction of enzymes causes the half-life to drop to 16h
        - Hence, the drug must be taken frequently in early administration and take levels at following intervals until constant levels
            - 3 weeks
            - 6 weeks
            - 9 weeks
            - 2 monthly thereafter, after getting 2 consecutive doses in range
    - The recommended starting dose in adults for seizures is 100mg BD
        - Increase dose by 100-200mg at fortnightly-monthly intervals based upon clinical response
        - Generally, do not exceed 1200mg daily
- Epilepsy – discuss the relevance of therapeutic ranges in relation to carbamazepine
What does it mean if the patient is below the range? What does it mean if they are above the range?
    - For many anticonvulsant drugs, the correlation between serum concentration and efficacy is poor → judged by clinical response > serum concentration
    - If the level was below the therapeutic rage
        - No seizures → keep dose the same
        - Seizures → consider increasing the dose (until maximum)
            - Maximum dose is defined as slightly less than dose which produced dose-related toxicity, or near the upper limit of the target range
    - If the level was above the therapeutic range
        - No seizures → down-titrate the dose, due to increased risk of toxicity
        - Seizures → down-titrate the dose and consider 2nd drug or referral
- Serum concentrations found a level of 12mg/L (range 8-12). How does this relate to his diplopia? Toxicity levels and relevant side effects
    - As this patient’s concentration is in the upper range, the diplopia may be associated with dose-related toxicity
        - Ocular symptoms tend to occur first, followed by coma (late) and cardiac abnormalities
    - Diplopia results from impairment of the extra-ocular muscles as a result of Na+ channel blockade (cranial nerves, internuclear pathways)
    - Toxicity levels for carbamazepine
        - 8-12: therapeutic
        - 12-20: diplopia, nystagmus, blurred vision, dizziness, ataxia
        - 20-40: anticholinergic effects
        - ≥ 40: increased seizure risk, coma, cardiac conduction abnormalities
- Why is he still experiencing seizures despite drug concentrations being within therapeutic range?
    - There are several possibilities:
        - Non-constant levels
            - Given the patient’s erratic dosing, it is possible that his blood concentration has been sub-therapeutic at points (although he is currently experiencing toxicity)
        - Other contributing factors
            - Sleep deprivation
            - Alcohol
            - Illicit drugs
            - Psychological stress
            - Other medications
        - Treatment resistant epilepsy
- Epilepsy – strategies to minimize side effects of carbamazepine and assess treatment progress
    - Reduce side effects
        - Severe adverse effects occur suddenly → no evidence for routine biochemical or haematological monitoring
        - If concerned:
            - FBC: agranulocytosis, anaemia, thrombocytopaenia
            - LFTs: mild elevation might be expected
            - UEC: hyponatraemia
        - Establish a target range (can test 2-monthly to ensure below the maximal concentration after dose adjustment)
        - Drug and lifestyle counselling
        - Consider extended-release tablets
        - Testing for genes associated with toxicity is advised
            - HLA-B*1502 (carbamazepine and risk of SJS)
    - Monitor progress
        - Progress of treatment is measured clinically
        - Seizure and side effects diary
- Sodium valproate → MoA, AEs, drug interactions
    - Mechanism: various effects to reduce neuronal excitability
        - Na+ channel blockade
        - Increased GABA concentration by inhibiting GABA transaminase
            - Increases Cl influx (GABA mediated) and hyperpolarisation of neurons
    - Use
        - First line for generalised tonic-clonic or unknown seizures
    - AEs
        - Teratogenic → neural tube defects
        - GI distress
        - Tremor
        - PCOS phenotype (weight gain, irregular periods, alopecia, hirsutism)
        - Rare → rashes, blood dyscrasias, hepatic failure
- Lamotrigine (mechanism, use, AEs)
    - Mechanism: decreases neuronal excitability
        - Na+ channel blockade
        - Decreased glutamate concentration
    - Use: both focal and generalised seizures
        - Useful in pregnancy (not teratogenic)
    - AEs
        - Skin rash and SJS (titrate slowly and observe for severe drug reaction)
        - Ataxia
        - Headache, nausea and insomnia
- Epilepsy – what counselling would you provide about driving and employment
    - Driving
        - eTG instructs medical practitioners to advise drivers with epilepsy that they:
            - Have a legal obligation to report the condition to the driver licencing authority in their state or territory
            - Should not drive until deemed fit by the licencing authority, in consultation with their doctor
        - In general, Australian Road Guidelines suggest that patients should be able to drive provided that:
            - No seizures for 12 months (6 months if first, isolated seizure)
            - No residual damage from his seizures + no impact on driving
            - Other neurological cases are ruled out
        - Based on this, I would suggest that the patient see his GP following his admission and be assessed for his suitability to perform his job and drive
            - Note in the discharge referral to ensure follow-up
    - Work
        - Emphasise the importance of not driving and offer alternatives (e.g. shuttle bus)
        - Offer to write a letter to his boss to re-allocate him to a role which does not require driving
- Status epilepticus - definition, management
    - Most seizures are brief, self-resolving and do not require drug treatment
        - Focus is supportive care (A-E) and investigations
    - Status epilepticus is defined after:
        - 5 minutes of continuous seizure activity
        - Repeated seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks
    - Medical emergency which requires urgent treatment
        - Benzodiazepine (e.g. IV midazolam, diazepam, clonazepam)
        - Antiepileptic drugs (if benzodiazepines are ineffective)
            - Phenytoin, levetiracetam
        - Transfer to ICU (if refractory) and contact specialist services
- Steven-Johnson syndrome
    - Severe drug reaction → side effect of antiepileptic drugs, sulfa drugs, penicillins
        - Characterised by fever, bullae, necrosis
            - Sloughing of skin at dermis-epithelium junction
            - Involvement of mucous membranes (high mortality)
    - Classifications
        - < 10% surface area = SJS
        - 10 ≤ x < 30% = SJS-TEN
        - ≥ 30% = TEN
- Focal epilepsy syndromes in adults
    - Most focal epilepsies are the result of a structural brain abnormality
    - Temporal lobe epilepsy (most common → 40% of all epilepsy, 2/3 of focal epilepsy)
        - Seizures commonly occurs in clusters (last approximately 30s - 2 mins) and follow a specific sequence
            1. Aura (sensory or inexplicable “dreamy” state)
            2. Focal seizure with impaired awareness and may present with:
                1. Head turning (towards affected side)
                2. Automatisms (e.g. lip smacking, fidgeting)
                3. Stretching of the body
                4. Walking in place
                5. Autonomic symptoms (e.g. tachycardia)
            3. Post-ictal phase (confusion, tiredness, transient amnesia)
        - Has an unfavourable prognosis (only 40% of patients remain asymptomatic on pharmacotherapy)
    - Frontal lobe epilepsy (25%)
        - Usually causes short (<30s) focal aware seizures with no aura or post-ictal confusion, often during sleep
        - Motor (muscle tension, vocalisation, (contralateral) gaze deviation
            - Often characterised by bizarre hypermotor behaviours which may be mistaken for psychogenic non-epileptic seizures
            - May demonstrate Jacksonian march (spread of seizure from one part of the body to adjacent areas)
            - Patients may develop Todd’s paresis
- General AE profile for anticonvulsants
    - Neuropsychiatric morbidity
        - Sedation, impaired concentration, confusion
        - Depression, anxiety, emotional lability
    - Rare but potentially life-threatening blood dyscrasias (e.g. agranulocytosis, red cell aplasias, leukopenias, thrombocytopenias)
        - May develop suddenly (regular monitoring not shown to add value)
        - Includes carbamazepine, sodium valproate, levetiracetam
    - Interacts with thyroxine metabolism (may require increased doses of thyroid medication)
        - Includes: carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital
    - Rare but potentially life-threatening drug eruptions and rashes (SJS, TEN, DRESS, anaphylaxis)
        - Includes: carbamazepine, sodium valproate, levetiracetam
- General patient education principles for epilepsy
    - Education about epilepsy, may be lifelong and the importance of compliance and adherence to medications
        - Education around the lifestyle factors which can lower seizure threshold (e.g. poor sleep)
    - Education around the risks associated with epilepsy
        - Seizure events → drowning, head trauma, car accidents, burns
        - Sudden unexplained death
        - Increased rates of mental health problems
        - Risks associated with contraception (CYP450 interactions) and pregnancy (teratogenic)
    - Educate parents, family, friends and carers about seizure first-aid
        - Make the patient safe (remove hazards)
        - Call 000 and continue for ≥ 5 mins
        - Stay with them until help arrives
