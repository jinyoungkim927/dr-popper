    - Mechanisms
        - Nasal hairs and mucus
        - Lymphoid tissue (Waldeyer’s ring) + secreted IgA to block epithelial attachments
        - Entrapment of microbial organisms in mucous blanket and removal by mucociliary elevator (from terminal bronchioles to trachea)
            - Airway mucus → produced by secretory cells (goblet, serous)
                - Contains mucins and antimicrobial molecules (IgA, lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, lyzozyme)
                - Rapid turnover of mucosal cells → antibacterial effect
        - LRT
            - Alveolar macrophages
            - Serum antibodies (IgM, IgG) in alveolar lining fluid to activate complement

        - S. aureus
    - Immunocompromised
        - Fungi (PJP, aspergillus, cryptococcus neoformans)
        - M. tuberculosis
        - Legionella
- Complications of pneumonia
    - Respiratory
        - Type 1 respiratory failure
            - Due to impaired oxygenation of blood from alveolar exudate
        - Pleural effusion
        - Abscess
        - Pleural empyaema
    - Non-respiratory
        - Bacteraemia → meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis
            - Septic shock
        - Development of comordities related to treatment
            - DVT/PE while immobilised
            - Catheter related infection
            - Cardiovascular complications (e.g. arrhythmias)
- Treatment of pneumonia
    
    **Supportive management**
    
    - Admission if moderate to severe (CURB-65)
    - Supplemental O2
    - Fluid and electrolyte replacement as needed
    
    **Definitive management - antibiotics**
    
    - Mild (outpatient - oral therapy)
        - Empirical treatment
            - Amoxicillin 1g PO for 5-7 days (typical)
            - Doxycycline 100mg BD for 5-7 days (atypical) OR clarithromycin
    - Moderate
        - Amoxicillin (PO if tolerated) or benzylpenicillin IV 1.2g Q6h
        - Doxycycline 100mg oral BD OR clarithromycin
    - Severe
        - Cefotaxime 2g IV daily for 7 days
        - Azithromycin 500mg IV daily for 3-5 days
        - Consider
            - Vancomycin for MRSA
            - Piperacillin-tazobactam for Pseudomonas
                - Ciprofloxacin is the only PO anti-pseudomonal antibiotic
            - Gentamicin for sepsis risk
            - Clindamycin for anaerobic cover above diaphragm
    - Treat for 5 days if good response in 2-3 days of treatment (otherwise 7 days)
- Why would you not use **amoxicillin** on *mycoplasma pneumoniae*? What antibiotics would you used instead? Would you consider using gentamicin?
    - Amoxicillin is an extended spectrum penicillin which works by inhibiting transpeptidase mediated cross-linking of peptidoglycan in the cell wall
        - Does not work for M. pneumoniae as it does not have a peptidoglycan cell wall
    - Choice of antibiotics
        - Protein synthesis inhibitors
            - Doxycycline 100mg PO BD - tetracycline
            - Azithromycin 500mg daily - macrolide
        - Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside (protein synthesis inhibitor) and would work
            - Not considered 1st or 2nd line → better options exist with fewer side effects
- Method of taking a sputum culture
    - Inform patient, obtain consent and check details
    - Patient rinses mouth with water or saline
        - Ask them to perform deep coughing
        - Sometimes induction may be needed with sterile hypertonic saline (10% NaCl) to loosen phlegm
    - Take a deep breath, cough and expectorate sputum into sterile cup (aim 15mL)
    - Phlegm into a sterile cup which is labelled and sent to the lab for culture
- Tests for S. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma
    - Streptococcus pneumoniae
        - Gram stain: Gram positive diplococci
        - Culture (blood agar) → alpha-haemolytic and optochin sensitive
        - Pneumococcal urinary antigen assay
            - Can quickly identify S. pneumoniae as the causative agent (before or after starting antibiotics)
    - Chlamydia pneumoniae
        - Difficult to gram stain (Gram negative obligate intracellular)
            - Can use Giemsa stain
        - Nasopharyngeal swab for NAAT
        - Serology
    - Mycoplasma pneumoniae
        - Does not gram stain (no cell wall)
        - Culture (fastidious) - can be cultured on a specialised medium but expensive and takes 2-3 weeks
        - Other tests
            - PCR of sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs
            - Serology (IgM)
            - Cold agglutination test (due to presence of antibodies to M. pneumoniae)
- How does a gram stain work?
    1. Cells are stained with crystal violet die (purple)
        - Positively charged and binds to negative charges in the cell wall
    2. Addition of iodine binds to the dye and traps them in the wall
    3. Washing of crystal violet with acetone or ethanol
        - Washes violet stain from gram-negative wall which is too thin to retain it
    4. Counter-stain with safranin (pink)
        - Gram negative cells are stained pink
- Lung abscess in pneumonia - pathophysiology
    - Lung abscess is a localised area of suppurative necrosis of the pulmonary parenchyma caused by microbial infection
        - Commonly polymicrobial (bacteria in oral cavity) → common monomicrobial causes (S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia)
    - Sources of infection
        - Aspiration of oral bacteria (most common)
        - Bacteraemia (S. aureus)
        - Pneumonia (S. aureus)
        - Septic emboli (S. aureus)

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
    - Aetiology
        - Underlying mechanisms include microvascular injury and alveolar epithelial damage
        - Direct pulmonary
            - Diffuse infections (often viral)
            - Inhalation of smoke or toxic gas
            - Massive gastric aspiration
        - Systemic disorders
            - Major trauma or burns
            - Gram negative sepsis
            - Tumours (e.g. pancreatic)
            - Obstetric complications (e.g. pre-eclampsia, amniotic fluid embolism)
    - Pathophysiology - cause of T1RF
        - Aggressive systemic inflammatory response precipitates increased lung endothelial (disrupts cadherin molecules) and alveolar epithelial permeability (pulmonary oedema)
            - Fluid accumulation causes a V/Q mismatch, hypoxaemia and intrapulmonary shunting
            - May be exacerbated by surfactant inactivation (e.g. pancreatitis) which causes atelectasis
        - Pro-coagulant inflammatory state enables fibrin deposition → component of hyaline membrane formation
    - Can be diagnosed by the Berlin Criteria
- Explain toxic granulation and band forms
    - Toxic granulation
        - Dark granules found particularly in neutrophils and suggest an inflammatory process
    - Band neutrophils are slightly immature compared to segmented PMNs
        - Have an indented, unsegmented, C or S shaped nuclei
        - Increased proportion seen in infectious and inflammatory conditions
- What are air bronchograms and what do they represent?
    - Refers to an air-filled bronchi (dark) made visible by opacification of surrounding alveoli
        - Almost always caused by an alveoli process due to consolidation
        - Tends to indicate patent proximal airways
- What could you look for in urine?
    - If available, pneumococcal urinary antigen tests have high specificity and moderate sensitivity
        - Useful to rapidly achieve a definitive diagnosis in pneumonia patients
- Compare lobar v. interstitial v bronchopneumonia

### Memorandum: atypical pneumonia (pharmacology)

*A 30-year-old female patient presents with 12 days of low grade fever, non-productive cough, malaise and lethargy. On auscultation she has bilaterally crackles over all the zones of her lungs. Her vitals were as follows: HR 120 BP140/90 RR 26 Temp 37.8. She was seen by her GP, given amoxicillin and sent home. She later represents and her chest X-ray reveals lower lobe consolidation.*
