        - May spread to larger joints (e.g. wrist, ankle, knee)
- Describe a normal synovial joint
    - Key structures
        - Articular capsule (continuous with periosteum) → fibrous and synovial layers
        - Articular hyaline cartilage (relatively avascular)

        - Fibrous
            - Cranial sutures
            - Syndesmoses (e.g. tibiofibular)
            - Gomphoses (teeth)
        - Cartilaginous
            - Pubic symphysis
            - Intervertebral disc
        - Synovial

        - Synarthrosis (immovable)
        - Amphiarthrosis (slight movement)
        - Diarthrosis (free movement)
- What is the pathophysiology of RA
    - Systemic autoimmune disease with a complex and incompletely understood pathophysiology - caused by a combination of:
        - Genetic factors (FHx, HLA-DRB1)
        - Environmental factors (smoking, ?infection)
    - Results in an autoimmune response characterised by type III and type IV hypersensitivity
        - Deposition of antibody-antigen immune complexes (III)
        - Cell-mediated damage (IV)
        - **Damage to the synovium leads to hyperplasia (pannus) and inflammatory infiltrate (produce mediators which upregulate RANK-L and protease production)**
            - **Destroy underlying cartilage and bone**
    - In the joints, key features include:
        - Synovial hyperplasia with resultant overproduction of synovial fluid and release of inflammatory mediators
        - Recruitment of inflammatory cells
            - Produce inflammatory cytokines and degradative enzymes (e.g. MMPs, RANK-L)
            - In synovium → T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes
            - In synovial fluid → neutrophils
            - Underlying CT → antigen-presenting cells
        - Formation of pannus
            - **Fibroinflammatory mass composed of inflamed synovial cells, inflammatory cells and CT**
        - Angiogenesis to support pannus
        - **Destruction of cartilage, bone and surrounding tissues**
            - **Cartilage due to MMP and pannus invasion**
            - **Bone due to RANK-L (osteopaenia), pannus erosion, MMPs**

            - Predispose to subluxation, contractures
        - Septic arthritis
    - Effect

            - Subluxation, contractures
            - Dislocations, ankylosis
        - Compression of adjacent neurovascular structures
- What is RF and anti-CCP
    - Rheumatoid factor
        - IgM antibody against the Fc portion of IgG
    - Anti-CCP antibody
        - Targets citrillunated arginine resides on synovial proteins
            - Citrulline often makes proteins non-functional (when replacing arginine) and hence can elicit an immune response
- What radiological findings may you see in RA?
    - Decreased joint space
        - Invasion of cartilage by pannus and increased production of cartilage MMP
        - Breakdown of ECM
    - Erosion of bone at joint margin
        - Increased bone resorption from osteoclasts triggered by RANK-L
        - Increased MMP secretion by synovial cells and erosion by pannys
    - Juxta-articular or peri-articular osteopaenia
        - Action of RANK-L resorption and MMPs
    - Deformities (due to tendon or ligament rupture)
    - Soft tissue swelling and inflammation of tissues surrounding involved joints
        - Synovial cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy
        - Increased vascularity due to angiogenesis

        - Patient assessment of pain
        - Patient and evaluator global assessment of disease activity
        - Acute phase reactants (CRP, ESR)
    - Composite measures combine the above and the Clinical Disease Activity Index can guide severity
    - Remission is defined as:
        - CDAI ≤2.8
        - Meet all of the following criteria:
        •Swollen joint count ≤1
        •Tender joint count ≤1
        •Patient global assessment (on a 1 to 10 scale) ≤2
- What would be your measures of treatment success?
    - Remission defined as:
        - Symptomatic relief AND
        - Absence of joint swelling AND
        - Normal CRP or ESR
    - Hence, monitor clinical symptoms (activity levels), affected joints and CRP
- NSAIDS (types, action, CIs)
    - Types
        - Non-selective (more GI, renal, resp AEs)
            - Ibuprofen
            - Diclofenac
            - Indomethacin
            - Naproxen
        - COX-2 selective (more CVS AEs with bleeding risk)
            - Celecoxib
            - Meloxicam
    - Absolute
        - Known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs
        - Asthma sensitive to aspirin or NSAIDs
        - Active GI bleeding or PUD
        - Trimester 3 pregnancy
            - Can cause premature closure of DA
    - Relative
        - Previous Hx of GI haemorrhage, PUD or asthma
        - Hepatic, renal or cardiac impairment
        - IBD
        - Other products containing aspirin or salicylates

- Methotrexate
    - Anti-folate anti-metabolite
    - Use
        - **Cancer (leukaemia, lymphoma, choriocarcinoma)**
        - Ectopic pregnancy
        - RA, psoriasis
            - **Mainstay of RA therapy (given once weekly with folate to minimise AEs)**
        - IBD
    - Mechanism (in RA)
        - Folic acid metabolism inhibition
            - Competitive inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase → decreased tetrahydrofolate → inhibits DNA synthesis
        - Adenosine receptor-mediated effects
            - Increased adenosine → anti-inflammatory actions
        - Other
            - Suppression of B and T cell replication
            - IL1 suppression
    - AEs
        - **Hepatotoxicity**
        - **GI effects (nausea, vomiting, mucositis)**
        - **Teratogenic**
            - CI in pregnancy → neural tube defects
        - **Myelosuppression**
            - Leucovorin (rescue therapy to prevent or reverse)
        - Interstitial pneumonitis
        - Malignancy (lymphoproliferative)
    - Monitoring
        - FBC, UEC and LFTs (weekly for first 4 weeks, then bimonthly)
- Lefluonomide
    - **Anti-pyrimidine antimetabolite**
    - Use
        - RA, psoriatic arthritis
    - Mechanism
        - Inhibits **dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase**
            - Inhibits pyrimidine synthesis and reproduction of rapidly dividing cells (e.g. T cells)
    - AEs
        - **GI intolerance (e.g. diarrhoea)**
        - **Myelosuppression**
        - **Hepatotoxicity (need LFT monitoring)**
        - Rashes
        - Hypertension
        - **Teratogenic**
            - Contraindicated in pregnancy
- Biological agents in RA
    - Commonly used as disease modifying agents in RA
        - Reduce joint damage and alter disease progression
    - Most effective when combined with MTX
        - TNF-a inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab)
        - IL-1 inhibitors (tocilizumab)
    - AEs (general)
        - Headache
        - GI upset (abdominal pain, nausea)
        - Injection site reaction
        - Predisposition to infection
            - Screen for HBV, HCV, TB
        - Can lead to drug-induced lupus
- **What investigations would you do before commencing TNF-a inhibitors?**
    - Patients on biologic DMARDs or tofacitinib (targeted synthetic DMARD) are at higher risk of infections, especially opportunistic infections)
        - **Screen for active infection**
            - **History of TB infection and environmental exposure**
            - **Test for HBV and HCV**
        - Assess vaccination status
            - **Consider booster of influenza, pneumococcal, shingles as needed**
            - Do not give live vaccines if on immunomodulator
        - **Check UEC, LFT and FBC + CXR which may influence choice of drug + provide a baseline measurement for comparison**
            - eTG states:
                - Baseline test for dsDNA antibodies (may develop rise)
                - CI in heart failure/demyelinating disorders with infliximab and adalumimab [AVOID]
