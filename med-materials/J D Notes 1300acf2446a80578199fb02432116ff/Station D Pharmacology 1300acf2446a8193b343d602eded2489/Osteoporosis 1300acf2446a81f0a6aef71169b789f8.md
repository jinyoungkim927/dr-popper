# Osteoporosis

## Case Protocol 5 – **Osteoporosis**

**Case:** *An 81-year-old woman was brought to the Emergency Department after a fall whilst shopping. She had severe pain in her left hip and was unable to stand. Her left leg was shortened and externally rotated. Radiological examination confirmed the clinical diagnosis of a fractured neck of the femur, and appropriate orthopaedic management was instituted.*

*Two days after admission to the hospital, she developed a low-grade fever (38.2) and at this stage examination of the chest revealed bilateral basal crackles and occasional coarse wheezes. A day later she developed a cough productive of mucopurulent sputum and her temperature rose to 39.4. Appropriate investigations were ordered and presumptive treatment commenced. However, at 1.00 am the following morning she became acutely dyspnoeic, collapsed and could not be resuscitated. An autopsy was performed.*

        - Pre-menopausal women, men < 50 (**Z-score**: compared to age, ethnicity and sex-matched reference population)
            - Low BMD (< -2.0)
            - Z-score can be used to check secondary osteoporosis (bone loss in excess of what is expected with normal ageing)
- Pathophysiology of osteoporosis
    - Normal bone physiology involves a careful balance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity regulated through the RANK-RANKL and OPG system
        - Osteoporosis is due to an imbalance in the activity of these cell types resulting in net resorption of bone
    - Two pathogenic mechanisms include post-menopausal osteoporosis and senile osteoporosis
    - Post-menopausal osteoporosis
        - Reduced oestrogen levels in post-menopausal females contributes to an increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-a)
            - Increased RANK-L release, decreased OPG releast
            - Increased osteoclast activity
        - Compensatory increase in osteoblast activity cannot match bone resorption
            - Results in a high-turnover form of osteoporosis
            - Excessive loss of trabecular bone
        - Note: oestrogen normally
            - Reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators
            - Induces apoptosis of osteoclasts (increased TGF-B levels)
    - Senile osteoporosis
        - Due to the age-related decline in osteoblast activity with age (’low-turnover’) despite normal osteoclastic activity
            - Occurs in both men and women
            - Equal loss of trabecular and cortical bone
        - Contributing factprs
            - Decreased weight-bearing exercise with age
            - Reduced production of matrix-inducing growth factors by osteoprogenitor cells
            - Reduced response to growth factors by osteoblasts

            - Breast cancer>
                - oestrogen only no increased risk ( is this isolated to post menopausal women?)
                - estrogen + progesten slight increased risk
            - 
            - Management approach to osteoporosis

            - Depression (psychiatric overtones)
    - Secondary
        - Secondary hyperplasia due to decreased Ca absorption and/or increased phosphate
            - Most often in chronic renal disease (low vitamin D and high phosphate → low Ca)
        - Hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure
            - Raised ALP and PTH
    - Tertiary
        - Refractory (autonomous) hyperparathyroidism due to chronic renal disease
            - ++ PTH
            - + Ca 2+
    - Related diseases
        - Osteitis fibrosa cystica
            - Cystic bone spaces filled with brown fibrous tissue consisting of osteoclasts and deposited haemosiderin from haemorrhages
                - Results in bone pain
            - Due to raised PTH and classically associated with primary hyperparathyroidism (may also be seen in secondary)
        - Renal osteodystrophy
            - Renal disease → secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism → bone lesions
- Osteomalacia
    - Defective mineralisation of osteoid (osteomalacia) or cartilaginous growth plates (rickets, only in children)
        - Most commonly due to vitamin D deficiency
    - X-ray findings
        - Osteopenia and pseudofractures in osteomalacia
        - Epiphyseal widening and metaphyseal cupping or fraying in rickets
            - Children with rickets have genu varum, craniotabes (soft skull), bead-like costochondral junctions
    - Low vitamin D = low serum Ca = high PTH = low PO4
        - Hyperactivity of osteoblasts = high ALP
- Pathobiology of bone healing
    - Inflammatory stage
        - Immediate attempt to stabilise bone with a haematoma and provide the foundations of healing
            - Haematoma formation and inflammatory response

            - Resorption of 1-2mm of bone at the fracture edge
    - Reparitive
        - Angiogenesis to supply nutrients to developing cartilage or bone
        - Callus formation
            - Cartilaginous callus (fibrocartilage scaffold forms between the two bones)
            - Bony callus (woven bone formed by mineralisation and endochondral calcification)
    - Remodelling phase
        - Endochondral (cartilaginous callus) is completely ossified
        - Bone undergoes structural remodelling by osteoblast-osteoclast interaction
            - Fortifies the callus along the line of mechanical force and resorbs other bone

- Difference between clinical and radiographic union
    - Clinical union
        - Bone does not shift on clinical examination
        - Non-tender fracture site
        - Can use affected bone without significant pain
    - As the initial callus is cartilaginous, clinical union may occur before evidence of radiographic union

        - Targeted other examinations (postural BP, neurological examination, gait, vision)
- Vitamin D - ways of administration and rationale for treatment
    - Vitamin D is typically given orally → the body tends to self-regulate absorption. by what is needed with the remainder faecally excreted
        - Activated vitamin D is important for dietary absorption of Ca and PO4
    - Vitamin D supplements (cholecalciferol)
        - Available in capsules of varying units
        - Cheaper than activated vitamin D
    - Vitamin D metabolites (calcitriol)
        - Available in 0.25 and 0.5 microgram capsules
        - Preferred in CKD (impaired vitamin D metabolism) → monitor for hypercalcaemia
            - Also useful in liver disease (may use calcidiol)
- PTH analogue - teriparatide
    - Mechanism
        - Intermittent administration of PTH activates osteoblasts (stimulates bone formation)
        - Use: last-line medication for daily injections for a once-off period → expensive
            - Use for a period < 18 months
    - AE
        - Nausea and vomiting
        - Dizziness
        - Hypercalcaemia, cramps

        - Often used in women < 60 with menopausal symptoms
    - May increase recurrence of breast cancer and stroke in women older than 60
- Denosumab (mechanism, use, AEs)
    - Mechanism
        - Monoclonal antibody which binds to RANK-L
            - Inhibits osteoclast differentation and reduced bone resorption
            - Increases BMD
    - Use: 6mthly sc inj
    - AE
        - Minimal (non-specific): rash, hypercholesterolaemia, nausea and vomiting
        - Osteonecrosis of jaw (rare
- Bisphosphonates (mechanism, use, AEs)
    - 1st line, cheap, effective, safe
    - e.g. alendronate, risendronate (PO), zoledronic acid (IV)
    - Mechanism
        - Binds to bone surface
            - Taken up by osteoclasts and inhibits attachment + promotes apoptosis of osteoclasts
            - May interact with osteoblasts to inhibit osteoclast activation
        - Increases BMD
    - Use
        - PO or injection every 6-12 months
        - Must be given prior to meals + sit upright (poor GIT absorption)
    - AE
        - GI disturbance (abdominal pain, nausea, heartburn, oesophagitis)
        - MSK pain
        - Osteonecrosis of the jaw (related to high dose, poor oral hygiene)
        - Atypical femoral fractures (possible due to poor architecture of new bone - fragile)
- Vitamin D metabolism
    - Vitamin D is obtained from diet or conversion of c7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to **cholecalciferol** **(Vitamin D3)** by UV light
    - Stored in the liver as 25-hydroxyvitamin D
        - Catalysed by 25-hydroxylase
        - Serum level of 25-VitD is the best measure of overall vitamin D status
    - Converted in the PCT of the kidney to **1,25(OH)2VitD (calcitriol)**
