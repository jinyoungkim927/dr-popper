# Depression

## Case Protocol 44 - **Depression**

**Case*:** A 70yo lady, currently on hypertensive medications was brought in by her daughter who is worried because she has noticed her mother has been disinterested lately. She has lost weight, isn’t sleeping well and can’t seem to concentrate. On history and exam, you come to diagnosis of depression.*

**Case:**

*A 32-year-old single mother with 2 children under the age 5 comes to see you, her GP, complaining about having headaches and lack of energy. She is unemployed and divorced 6 months ago. On further questioning, she reveals that she has had little appetite and has lost 5 kg in the last two months. She struggles to fall asleep, often wakes up in the middle of night and finds it hard to get back to sleep. She has lost interest in doing things that she used to enjoy, like walking and gardening, as well as worrying about her parenting. She finds herself losing her temper easily and yells at her children, leading her to believe that she is a bad mother. She often feels like crying for no apparent reason. On discussing the situation with this woman, you believe that she is suffering from major depression. You discuss options for therapy, including CBT and pharmacotherapy. She does not feel she can commit to CBT at the present time*

- Risk factors and pathophysiology of depression
    - Risk factors
        - Non-modifiable
            - Genetic → first degree relative with MDD increases risk
                - Likely to have large environmental component
            - Temperament → influences susceptibility and phenotype
            - Biochemical (e.g. monoamine hypothesis)
            - Endocrine - HPA dysfunction, post-partum state
            - **Environment - adverse childhood experiences, trauma, stressful life events**
            - Ageing (affects neurotransmitter pathways)
        - Modifiable
            - Drug, alcohol and substance use
- Natural history of depression
    - Large life event or environmental stressor precedes first episode
        - Results in long-lasting change to the brain’s biology, neurotransmitters, signalling systems
        - Predisposes to future episode
    - Variable course
        - First episode has 50% chance of recovery in 1st year
        - Some rarely experience remission
    - Risk of recurrence becomes lower over time as duration of remission increases

        - Note: severity and phenotype inform the necessity for medical treatment
            - Severity
                - Mild depression → non-pharmacological interventions
                - Moderate-severe depression → combination of psychotherapy and pharmacology
            - Phenotype
                - Features of melancholia, catatonia, psychosis should commence medical therapy
        - General approach
            - Counsel that the effect of antidepressants may take up to 2 weeks (full effect up to 8 weeks)
            - Start 1st line antidepressant + assess response after 2-4 weeks
                - If no response, increase dose and reassess in 2-4 weeks
                - If still no response, switch to a different drug (move to second line)
            - Consider augmenting agents as needed
                - Anxiolytics
                - Mood stabilisers (lithium)
                - Antipsychotics (atypical)
                - Stimulants (methylphenidate, dexamphetamine)
                - Melatonin agonist (agomelatine)
            - Key principles
                - Optimisation - ensure adequate drug doses
                - Augmentation - add medication which is not considered an antidepressant
                - Combination - add another antidepressant
                - Substitution - change the primary antidepressant (within or outside a class)
        - First-line treatments
            - SSRIs (escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline)
            - SNRIs (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine)
            - Other (NaSSA - mirtazapine)
        - Second line
            - Agomelatine (melatonin agonist)
            - Moclobemide (RIMA)
            - Reboxetine (selective NRI)
        - Failure to respond to initial agents
            - Tricyclic antidepressants
            - Irreversible MAOIs (psychiatrist input)
        - Consider electroconvulsive therapy
    - Procedural
        - Electroconvulsive therapy (6-12 treatments) - repeated induced seizures under GA
            - Indicated in severe, treatment-resistant depression (or melancholic, psychotic, catatonic)
                - Can be first line in those with acute severe suicidality, catatonia, poor self care
            - Most effective form of treatment (can be 85% successful at first line)
            - AEs
                - Anaesthetic risks
                - Temporary memory loss (often transient anterograde amnesia)
                - Headache, confusion, tiredness

- Pharmacology (anti-depressants)
    - SSRIs
        - e.g. escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine
            - Usually takes 4-8 weeks for effect
            - Fluoxetine is the only SSRI recommended for < 18 y.o.
        - Mechanism
            - Antagonist of serotonin reuptake transporter on presynaptic terminal → increased serotonin in the synapse
            - Compensatory downregulation of autoreceptors (delayed efficacy)
        - Types of serotonin receptor
            - 5HT1A - therapeutic (anxiolytic, antidepressant)
            - 5HT2A/2C (brain) → activation (anxiety, insomnia), weight gain
            - 5HT2A (spinal cord) → sexual dysfunction
        - Indications
            - MDD
            - GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder
            - OCD, bulimia, binge-eating disorder

            - Weight gain
            - Sexual dysfunction (loss of libido, anorgasmia)
    - SNRIs
        - e.g. duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine
        - Mechanism
            - Antagonist of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake transporter in presynaptic terminal → increased about in synaptic cleft
                - Duloxetine = equal effect on both transporters
                - Venlafaxine: 5HT > NA
            - Mainly serotonergic at low doses, NA effect increases at higher doses
        - AEs
            - Same as SSRIs (sedation, poor sleep and agitation, sexual dysfunction, weight gain)
            - Adrenergic effects → hypertension, stimulant effects, nausea
    - TCAs
        - e.g. amitriptyline (Endep), imipramine
        - Mechanism
            - Non-selective serotonin reuptake and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors
            - Off-target effects on muscarinic and adrenergic receptors
        - Indications
            - Refractory MDD (last-line)
            - Chronic neuropathic pain

                - Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness
            - Serotonergic
                - Sexual dysfunction, weight gain
            - Life-theratening
                - Prolonged QT
                - Lowers seizure threshold
        - Manage overdose with NaHCO3 to prevent arrhythmias
    - Mirtazapine (NaSSA)
        - Mechanism
            - Noradrenergic and selective serotonergic action

            - 5HT2 and 5HT3 antagonist
            - H1 antagonist
        - AEs
            - Sedation (H1 antagonism)

            - Hyperlipidaemia
        - Note: less sexual side effects
    - Melatonin agonists
        - e.g. agomelatine
        - Mechanism
            - Melatonin receptor agonist (MT1, MT2) and serotonin 5HT2C antagonist
            - Stimulates production of melatonin without raising serotonin levels
            - Improves onset and quality of sleep
        - Fairly well tolerated
            - Fewer sexual side effects, less weight gain
            - Hyperhidrosis, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, dizziness, somnolence
    - Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (RARELY USED)
        - e.g. tranylcypromine (non-selective MAOI), selegiline (MAOB selective)
        - Mechanism
            - Inhibits monoamine oxidase (enzyme which breaks down amines)
                - Increase levels of 5HT, adrenaline and dopamine
        - AEs
            - Tyramine (”cheese reaction”) → needs dietary modification to prevent hypertensive crisis
            - Many drug interactions and can precipitate serotonin syndrome

- Pharmacology (anxiolytics)
    - Benzodiazepines
        - E.g. diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), clobazam (long-acting)
        - Mechanism
            - Positive allosteric GABA-a receptor modulator → binds between a and y subunits of receptor
                - Increase Cl influx → hyperpolarisation → decreased excitatory neurotransmission
        - Indication
            - Short-term management of anxiety
            - Seizure cessation
            - Alcohol withdrawal agitation
            - Stimulant overdose
        - AEs
            - Sedation
            - Decreased concentration
            - Drug of addiction → can develop tolerance and dependence
        - Precautions in substance use disorder and alcohol use disorder
    - Buspirone
        - Mechanism
            - Full agonist of pre-synaptic 5HT1A receptors and partial agonist of post-synaptic receptors
            - Acutely decreases serotonergic activity but eventually leads to increased activity (2-4 weeks) likely due to desensitisation to the drug and/or upregulation of serotonergic systems
            - Weak dopaminergic and adrenergic activity
        - Indications
            - GAD

        - St John’s wort
- How long will you keep her on pharmacological therapy?
    - Initial treatment period: 6-12 weeks
    - Duration
        - In patients with a favourable response, antidepressants should be continued for a minimum of 6 months (ideally 12)
            - Major risk of relapse in this period
            - Do not cease therapy simply because the patient is feeling better
        - If history of recurrence, longer term prophylaxis is recommended (3-5 years)
