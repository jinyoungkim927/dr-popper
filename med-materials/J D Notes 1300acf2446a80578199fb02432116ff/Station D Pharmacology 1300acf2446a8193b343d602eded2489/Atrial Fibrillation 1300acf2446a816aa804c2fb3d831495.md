- **Interpret ECG - PDx?**
    - Rhythm strip shows an irregularly irregular narrow-complex rhythm with absent P waves
        - Atrial fibrillation → SVT characterised by uncoordinated atrial activation resulting in an irregular ventricular response due to intermittent conduction through the AV node
- **AF, epidemiology, clinical features**
    - Epidemiology
        - Affects 1-2% of Australian population
    - Clinical features
        - Usually asymptomatic
            - May have chest pain, palpitations, syncope, fatigue, dyspnoea
        - Signs
            - Irregularly irregular pulse
            - May have pulse deficit between apex of heart and radial pulse (due to premature ventricular contractions = low stroke volume = no transmission of pressure to arm)
- **Classifications of AF**
    - Haemodynamic instability
        - Unstable
            - Signs of haemodynamic instability (e.g. chest pain, altered mental status, APO, hypotension, shock)
        - Stable
    - Ventricular rate
        - AF with rapid ventricular response (rate > 100-110)
        - AF with slow ventricular response (< 60)
    - Onset and duration
        - New onset
            - New presentation or diagnosis regardless of duration
        - Paroxysmal
            - Resolves within 7 days of onset (treatment or spontaneously)
            - Frequence of recurring episodes may vary
        - Persistent
            - Continuous for > 7 days
        - Long-standing
            - Continuous for > 1 year
        - Permanent
            - Therapeutic attempts no longer made to convert to or maintain sinus rhythm unless patient and doctor agree to do so
    - Mitral valve involvement
        - Valvular
            - Moderate or severe mitral stenosis or artificial valve
        - Non-valvular
- **Risk factors or causes of AF**
    - Reversible causes of AF
        - Sympathomimetic
            - Excess caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines
            - Phaeochromocytoma
        - Electrolyte imbalances
            - Hypomagnesaemia
            - Hypokalaemia
        - Endocrine
            - Thyrotoxicosis
        - Infection - fever
    - General vascular risk factors
        - Older age
        - HTN, smoking, DM, obesity, OSA
    - Intrinsic cardiac risk factors
        - IHD
        - VHD (esp. mitral heart disease causing lengthening of atria)
        - CCF
        - Arrhythmogenic
            - Pre-excitation tachycardia (e.g. WPW)
            - Sick sinus syndrome (SA dysfunction)
            - Congenital channelopathies
    - Non-cardiac
        - Pulmonary disease (COPD, PE, pneumonia)
        - CKD
        - Chronic excessive alcohol consumption
- Investigative approach to AF
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - ECG +/- Holter monitoring to assess correlation between fibrillation and symptoms
        - Echocardiogram (TTE)
            - Required in all patients with new onset AF → identify atrial thrombi
            - Assess cardiac function
    - Ancillary investigations
        - Identify possible underlying cause
            - FBC - anaemia, infection
            - TFTs - hyperthyroidism
            - Metabolic - UECs, CMP, serum glucose
            - Consider troponins, BNP, D-dimer, serum or urine toxicology
        - Plan management
            - Coagulation panel
            - LFTs
        - Imaging
            - CXR - rule out DDx, pulmonary disease
- **Management approach to AF?**
    - Initial acute management
        - Address and correct reversible causes (electrolyte imbalances, associated illnesses)
        - Consider immediate and/or long term anticoagulation
    - Acute AF
        - Haemodynamically unstable
            - Primary survey, concurrent resuscitation, call for senior help
            - Rhythm control
                - First line → emergency electrical cardioversion
                    - Pre-treatment with anti-arrhythmic agents
                    - Pre-cardioversion anticoagulation (LMWH, UFH)
        - Haemodynamically stable
            - Onset < 48h
                - Rhythm or rate control may be attempted
                - Start heparin anticoagulation if delayed
            - Onset > 48h (increased risk of thrombus)
                - Rate control only
    - Chronic AF
        - Rate control is generally first line
        - Rhythm control used as first line if:
            - High risk (e.g. Hx of TIA or stroke)
            - Persistent symptoms despite adequate rate control
            - Inability to achieve rate control
    - Anticoagulation
        - Valvular AF
            - Required in all patients (if no contraindications present)
        - Non-valvular AF
            - Guided by CHA2DS2-VASc score
- **Difference between rhythm and rate control**
    - Rhythm control
        - Goal to restore coordinated atrial contraction
        - Consider in patients:
            - Who have already been treated with anticoagulants for ≥ 3 weeks
            - Have had echocardiography has rule out the presence of LA thrombus
            - Haemodynamically unstable
        - Attempt
            - Electrical cardioversion
            - Pharmacological
                - 1st line (no IHD and normal LB function)
                    - Flecainide
                        - Use in combination with AV nodal blocking drug (e.g. B-blocker, non-dihydropyridine CCB) to decrease risk of conversion to atrial flutter (1:1)
                    - Sotalol
                - 2nd line
                    - Amiodarone (first-line in IHD and/or abnormal LV function)
            - **Surgical**
                - **Catheter ablation (pulmonary vein isolation)**
    - Rate control
        - Goal is to normalise the ventricular heart rate < 110 BPM to improve filling and CO
        - Pharmacological
            - 1st line
                - Beta blockers (cardioselective - bisoprolol)
                - Non-dihydropyridine CCB (avoid in CCF as negative inotropes) (e.g. verapamil)
            - 2nd line
                - Amiodarone
                - Digoxin (in patients with concomitant CCF)
            - Rate control drugs should not be used in patients with WPW (can accelerate conduction down accessory pathway)
        - Surgical
            - AV node ablation
            - Implantation of permanent ventricular pacemaker
- **Compare atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter**
    - Atrial fibrillation
        - Uncoordinated atrial contraction
        - Affects both atria but typically originates in the LA
        - No discernable P waves on ECG
        - Manage with rate control, rhythm control and anticoagulation
    - Atrial flutter
        - Continuous rapid atrial contraction (300/min) with regular conduction through the AV node (e.g. 2:1 (150) or 4:1 (75))
        - Often originates in the RA due to a re-entry circuit in the atrium
        - Saw tooth waves on ECG
        - Manage with good rate control > rhythm control (more tachycardiac) + anticoagulation
- **Complications of AF**
    - Acute
        - Haemodynamic compromise
    - Chronic
        - Mural thrombi formation → systemic embolisation (eg. stroke)
- **What is the CHA2Ds2-VASc score?**
    - Score which evaluates risk of TIA or stroke or systemic emboli from AF
        - 2 points
            - Age ≥ 75
            - Previous stroke, TIA, thromboembolism
        - 1 point
            - CCF, hypertension, diabetes, age ≥ 65, vascular disease
    - Men ≥ 2 or women ≥ 3 should be started on oral anticoagulation
    - What is the HAS-BLED score
        - Score which estimates the risk of major bleeding secondary to anticoagulation
            - Hypertension (1) stroke (1)
            - Abnormal renal (1) or liver function (1)
            - Bleeding history or predisposition (1)
            - Labile INR (1)
            - Age > 65 (1)
            - Predisposing drugs (1) or EtOH use (1)
        - Interpretation
            - 0 points = low risk
            - 1-2 points = moderate risk
            - ≥ 3 points = high risk (use caution and regularly review)
- **Compare DOACs and warfarin**
    
    **Comparative advantages**
    
    | Warfarin | DOACs |
    | --- | --- |
    | Can be used in renal impairment | No need for routine laboratory monitoring |
    | Preferred drugs in valvular AF | Fewer drug interactions |
    | More readily reversible | Lower rates of intracranial bleeds  |
    
    Note: rivaroxaban can be used in renal impairment
    
    Note: warfarin is teratogenic and needs bridging with heparin (5 days)
    
- Anti-arrhythmic drugs
    - Indication
        - Used to prevent recurrent arrhythmias and restore sinus rhythm in patients with cardiac arrhythmias

                        - Steady state of block
                    - Extends duration of effective refractory period in both AV node and accessory tracts

            - Mechanism
                - Blocks K+ channels involved in cardiac repolarisation
                - Increases effective refractory period of AP (terminates SVTs, slows AV node)

            - B-blockers
                - Mechanism: blocks SNS activation
                    - Heart → blocks opening of Na and Ca channels
                        - Reduced HR (difficulty triggering APs in SA node and depolarising conduction system (AV node))
                        - Blocked tachycarrhythmias
                        - Decreased contractility (reduced activation of myosin)

                - Increased risk of re-entrant tachycardias (e.g. atrial flutter) as conduction velocity through accessory pathways is slowed
                    - APs are more likely to reach the junction with the main pathway after its refractory period is over
                - Other drug specific AEs (CNS depression or excitation, AV block)
            - Contraindications
                - Symptomatic bradycardia or cardiogenic shock
                - 2nd or 3rd degree heart block
