# Glaucoma

**Case 1:** An 86-year-old lady presented with gradual vision loss on a background of asthma and family history of **open angle glaucoma**.

**Case 2:** Margaret is a 64-year-old lady who has had progressive worsening of her peripheral vision over the last 12 months. Her ophthalmologist suspected the **diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma** and arranged for some investigations. She has a history of asthma (on inhaled salbutamol) but is otherwise well.

        - Different types of glaucoma
            - Closed angle
                - Pain
                - Poorly-reactive, mid-dilated pupil
                - Nausea and vomiting
                - Blurred vision
            - Normal or low tension glaucoma (normally asymptomatic)

- What is glaucoma?
    - Progressive optic neuropathy involving
        - Characteristic structural changes in optic nerve head
        - Irreversible visual field changes or loss (peripheral, then central)
    - Commonly (but not always) associated with high intraocular pressure
    - Classifications
        - Open angle (90%)
            - Iridocorneal angle is normal hence glaucoma from:
                - Impaired drainage of aqueous humour through trabecular meshwork
                    - May be from WCC (uveitis) or RCC (haemorrhage)
                - Excessive production of humour
            - Gradual increase in IOP → optic nerve damage
            - Insidious onset with peripheral vision loss but otherwise asymptomatic
        - Closed angle (<10%)
            - Iridocorneal angle is narrow (iris contacts trabecular meshwork and obstructs flow)
            - May be:
                - Primary
                    - Enlargement or anterior movement of the lens against pupil margin
                    - Obstructs aqueous flow into anterior chamber and pushes iris against cornea
                - Secondary
                    - Hypoxia from retinal disease (e.g. diabetes)
                        - Results in vasoproliferation in the iris which contracts angle
            - Can be very acute → eye pain
        - Normal tension glaucoma
            - No increased IOP
                - Normal iridocorneal angle
                - No impaired aqueous humour drainage
            - Optic nerve damage (possibly vascular compromise with diabetes or metabolic syndrome

- Compare open and closed angle glaucoma (epi, pathophys, clinical features)
    
    
    |  | Open angle | Closed angle |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Epidemiology | 90% | 10% |
    | Pathophysiology | Impaired drainage of flow through trabecular meshwork | Reduced iridocorneal angle → impaired trabecular flow |
    | Clinical features | Often asymptomatic. **Insidious and then progressive peripheral loss of vision**. Late stage loss of central vision | Acute onset with visual impairment, **frontal headache, severe eye pain**, halos around light, **fixed and mid-dilated pupil**, nausea and vomiting. **Examination findings (conjunctival erythema, corneal oedema)** |
- Investigative approach to glaucoma
    - Tonometry
        - Measures IOP
        - Screening tool → elevated IOP means higher risk of glaucoma but imperfect NPV
        - ≥ 23 mmHg is suggestive of glaucoma
    - Direct ophthalmoscopy
        - Cup:disc ratio of optic nerve
            - < 0.3 is normal
            - ≥ 0.6 is suspicious of glaucoma
    - Slit lamp biomicroscopy
        - Allows assessment of cornea, anterior chamber and drainage angle
        - Closed angle:
            - Hazy cornea
            - Shallow anterior chamber
            - Reduced iridocorneal angle
    - Perimetry - visual field testing
        - Scotomas (blind spots) indicate irreversible damage to optic nerve in this setting
    - Gonioscopy
        - Allows assessment of iridocorneal angle
    - Optical coherence tomography
        - Measures the thickness of the retina
        - Detects progression and monitors treatment

- Risk factors for open angle glaucoma
    - Strong
        - Older age (>60)
        - FHx of glaucoma
        - Ethnic background - African
        - Intraocular pressure > 23mmHg
        - Cup:disc ratio > 0.4
        - Steroid use
    - Weak
        - Myopia
        - Diabetes
        - Hypertension
- Management approach to open angle glaucoma
    - Goal: lower IOP and slow neurodegeneration
    - Pharmacological therapy is often used first
        - Other modalities can be selected (e.g. laser treatment, surgery)
            - If the patient has contraindications to eyedrops, poor compliance or rapidly progressive disease
    - First line: prostaglandin analogue
    - Second line
        - Beta-blockets (e.g. timolol, betaxolol)
        - Alpha-2 agonists (e.g. brimonidine)
        - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. dorzolamide, brinzolamide)
- Management of closed angle glaucoma
    - Emergency pharmacotherapy
        - Beta blocker
        - A2 agonist
    - Laser surgery
- How can medications in glaucoma reach the systemic circulation? How can this be prevented?
    - For the drug to be effective, it must enter the anterior chamber via the cornea
        - Some drug however may pass into the systemic circulation through the highly vascular nasal mucosa
            - Lacrimal puncta → canaliculi → sac → nasolacrimal duct → inferior meatus
    - Prevent by educating the patient about the Double DOT technique
        - Digital Occlusion of the Tear duct
        - Don’t Open the eye Technique (for 2-3 mins)
- Key principles for monitoring glaucoma
    - Regular follow up
        - Frequent depends on patient factors (compliance, preference) and disease factors (severity, level of control)
    - Key points
        - Efficacy of treatment
            - IOP
            - Cup:disc ratio
            - Visual fields
        - Safety of treatment
            - AEs

            - Compliance
            - Technique (DOT DOT)

- Normal physiology of aqueous humour production and drainage
    - Aqueous humor is the fluid which fills the anterior and posterior (not postremal) chambers
    - Function
        - Supplies nutrients to avascular cornea and lens
        - Maintains intraocular pressure (normal 12-22mmHg)
    - Produced by the ciliary processes into the posterior chamber
    - Two main pathways of drainage
        - Trabecular meshwork (90% of drainage)
            - Flows through pupil → anterior chamber → trabecular meshwork at iridocorneal angle → canal of Schlemm → veins
        - Uveoscleral pathway (10%)
            - Aqueous humour travels straight through the tissues of the ciliary muscle
            - Unconventional flow
                - Pressure-dependent
- Lacrimal apparatus - structure
    - Composed of lacrimal gland, ducts, lacrimal canaliculi, lacrimal sac, nasolacrimal duct
    - Lacrimal gland (serous)
        - Anterior in the superolateral orbit
        - Divided into two parts by LPS
            - Orbital part in lacrimal fossa of frontal bone
                - Supported by tendon of LPS
            - Palpebral part is small and inferior
    - Ducts drain secretions into the lateral part of the superior conjunctival fornix
        - Orbital part drains through palpebral part → distributed by blinking
    - Fluid accumulates medially in lacus lacrimalis and drained into the two lacrimal puncta
        - Openings of lacrimal canaliculi on the lacrimal papillae
    - Lacrimal canaliculi joins the lacrimal sac in the lacrimal groove
        - Anterior to the lacrimal part of the orbicularis oculi
        - When it contracts, may dilate sac and draw in tears
    - Lacrimal sac drains to nasolacrimal duct

- Anatomy of eye - chambers, walls
    - Chambers
        - Anterior chamber (between cornea and iris)
        - Posterior chamber
            - Between iris and lens
            - Iridocorneal angle = angle between cornea and iris
        - Both anterior and posterior chambers are continuous through the pupil and allow flow of aqueous humor
        - Postremal (vitreous) chamber
            - Posterior to lens
    - Walls
        - Outer fibrous layer
            - Sclera
            - Cornea (continuation anterioly)
        - Vascular layer
            - Choroid
                - Thin, highly vascular, pigmented layer attached firmly to the retina and loosely to the sclera
            - Ciliary body = ciliary muscle + ciliary processes
                - Ciliary muscle controls accommodation
                    - Contraction → relaxation of zonular fibres (of suspensory ligaments of lens) → lens become more rounded (near vision)
                - Ciliary processes
                    - Longitudinal ridges which contribute to aqueous humour production
            - Iris
                - Associated sphincter and dilator pupillae muscles
        - Inner layer (retina)
