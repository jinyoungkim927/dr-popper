# Acute Pulmonary Oedema

**Case:** *An elderly male patient with history of stage 2 CKD, left ventricular failure, AF, and other comorbidities. 2 days prior had started taking diclofenac for knee pain/osteoarthritis. His other medications include: metoprolol, quinapril, frusemide, digoxin, warfarin.Patient is now presenting acutely with shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. His BP is 160/90mmHg.*

- Case specific:
    - Presentation of acute dyspnoea, PND  and medical history suggests APO from fluid overload secondary to medication interactions between NSAIDs, diuretic and ACE inhibitor
    - Differentials
        - APO and other causes of acute dyspnoea
- Definition of APO
    - Rapid buildup of fluid in the alveoli and lung interstitium which has extravasated from pulmonary circulation
        - Accumulation of fluid = impaired gas exchange, decreased lung compliance
            - Presents as dyspnoea and hypoxia
- Causes of acute pulmonary oedema
    - Many precipitants for APO
    - Cardiogenic
        - Left ventricular failure
            - Acute coronary syndrome (acute MI)
            - Arrhythmias
            - Pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis
            - Valvular dysfunction (aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation)
        - Increased intravascular volume
            - Fluid overload (may have extra-cardiac causes)
            - Non-compliance with fluid restriction or diuretics
            - Renal failure
        - Pulmonary venous outflow obstruction
            - Mitral valve stenosis
    - Non cardiogenic
        - High output states
            - SIRS and sepsis
            - Anaemia
            - Thyrotoxicosis
        - Systemic increase of vascular permeability
            - Pancreatitis (SIRS)
            - Eclampsia
            - DIC
            - Burns
        - Toxins or environmental

        - Other
            - Head injury, intracranial haemorrhage
            - Drugs (NSAIDs, CCBs, naloxone)
            - Pulmonary embolus
- Pathophysiology of APO
    - Cardiogenic
        - Occurs when cardiac output drops despite an increase in systemic resistance
            - Blood returning to the left atrium exceeds blood leaving left ventricle
        - Results in backward failure and increased pulmonary venous pressure (and capillary pressure)
            - Leads to net filtration of transudate out of capillaries
    - Non-cardiogenic
        - Pathological processes which act either directly or indirectly on the pulmonary vascular permeability
            - Results in protein leakage from capillaries which increases interstitial oncotic pressure and fluid drawn from capillaries
- Predisposing and precipitating factors of cardiogenic APO
    - Predisposing conditions
        - LV systolic dysfunction (CAD, cardiomyopathy, VHD)
        - LV diastolic dysfunction (decreased compliance)
            - Hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathies
        - Mitral stenosis
        - Renovascular hypertension
    - Precipitating factors
        - Increased preload
            - Volume overload
            - Valvular pathology (acute aortic or mitral regurgitation)
        - Decreased contractility
            - AMI
            - Decompensated CCF

            - kerley B lines
                - Visible interstitial septal lines (peripheral first)
                - may also see peri-Bronchial cuffing (’tram tracking’, ‘doughnut sign’)
            - Cardiomegaly
                - Cardiothoracic ratio > 50% on PA
                    - Cannot measure on AP as objects nearer the X-ray tube appear artificially enlarged

                - Rule out AKI, electrolyte derangements
        - Imaging
            - Echocardiogram (quantify HF)
- Non-selective NSAIDs
    - E.g. ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac
    - Mechanism
        - Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes
            - Reduced synthesis of prostaglandins, prostacyclins and thromboxane A2 from arachidonic acid
        - Note:
            - COX-1 (constitutive)
                - Failure of GI protective mechanisms (mucosa blood flow, bicarbonate secretion, prostaglandins)
                - Failed platelet activation
                - Inhibitions vasodilation of afferent arterioles (affects TGF)
            - COX-2 (inducible with inflammation)
                - Anti-inflammatory, analgesia, anti-pyrexia
            - Greater production of leukotrienes by 5-lipooxygenase —> bronchoconstriction
    - Adverse effects
        - GI: gastritis, GI bleeding, peptic ulcer disease
        - CVS: bleeding, increased MI and stroke risk
            - Particularly with COX-2 selective (reduces prostacyclin, thus pro-thrombotic)
        - Renal: AKI (afferent arteriole constriction)
        - Respiratory: bronchospasm
            - Shunts AA pathway towards leukotrienes
        - Hypersensitivity - anaphylaxis, SJS
    - Precautions/contraindications
        - Avoid in known CVD, CKD, active PUD or GI bleeding, asthmatics
        - Teratogen in 3rd trimester —> premature closure of DA, impaired real development, prematurity risk
- B1-blockers
    - e.g. metoprolol, bisoprolol
        - Mechanism
            - Reduced effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline on:
                - Heart (decrease HR and contractility)
                - Kidney (reduced renin release)
        - Adverse effects

            - Increase bradykinin levels —> prevents peripheral vasoconstriction (precipitates vasodilation)
            - Reduce renal Na reabsorption (directly and via aldosterone)
            - Reduce ADH production (increased permeability of distal tubule
                - Insertion of aquaporin into apical membrane (mediated by V2 recetors)
    - Adverse effects (CAPTOPRIL)
        - **C** - Cough

        - **P - Pregnancy contraindicated**
        - **R** - Renal failure in renal artery stenosis (bilateral)
        - **IL - Idiosyncratic Leukopenia**
    - Precautions/contraindications
        - Should not take in combination with NSAIDs and diuretic
        - Bilateral renal stenosis → increased risk of renal failure
        - Avoid in pregnancy (especially 2nd and 3rd trimesters)
- Loop diuretics
    - E.g. frusemide
    - Mechanism
        - Blocks the Na/K/2Cl transporter in the thick aLH
            - Prevents Na reabsorption (site of 20% of Na retention)
            - Limits the maximum concentrating capacity of the nephron

        - Hyperkalaemia
        - Cholinergic - nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea
        - Xanthopsia (yellow filtering effect of eyes due to cataracts)
        - Cardiac - arrythmias, AV block
        - Note: small therapeutic range (toxic)
            - Cardiac arrhythmias, nausea and vomiting, blurry vision
    - Precautions/contraindications
        - Ventricular failure
        - Poor compliance (needs careful monitoring)
            - Toxicity most related to increased arrhythmia risk
- Triple whammy in APO
    - NSAIDs
        - Decrease PGE2 (afferent arteriole vasoconstriction) —> decrease eGFR
    - ACE inhibitors
        - Decrease AngII (efferent arteriole vasodilation) → decrease eGFR
    - Diurectics
        - Reduce plasma volume → decreased perfusion pressure and eGFR
- Management of APO
    - Assess patient (primary survey)
        - Establish IV access and continuous monitoring
    - Main priority is to identify and treat the precipitating cause
        - Cease offending medications
        - Consider causes (ACS, PE, arrythmia, valvular disease) which may need **definitive management urgently**
            - Give amiodarone infusion
    - Acute management
        - Improve oxygenation and decrease fluid overload
            - Posture (seat patient upright)
            - High-flow O2 (if < 95%)
                - Use CPAP (100% O2) if <92% → forces fluid back into interstitium
            - IV furosemide (20-80mg)
                - Use spironolactone if unresponsive
        - Decrease cardiac demand
            - IV nitrates (glyceryl trinitrate)

        - Fluid and salt restriction
        - Initiate weight monitoring
    - Note: LMNOP
        - Lasix, morphine, nitrates, oxygen, posture
