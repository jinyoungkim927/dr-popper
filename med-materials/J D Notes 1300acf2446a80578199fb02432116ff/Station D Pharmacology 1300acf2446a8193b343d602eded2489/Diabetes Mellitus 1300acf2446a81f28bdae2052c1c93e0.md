# Diabetes Mellitus

Case 1 - *A **13-year-old** girl was seen at home by her local doctor. She had been unwell for the past week, with increasing **weakness** and **lethargy**, and had also complained of **thirst** and **vague abdominal pains**. Her mother noted that the patient had **not been eating**, and had **vomited** repeatedly over the past two days.*

*Examination revealed a **pale, thin, drowsy** girl with **dry mucosae** and **ketotic foetor**. She was admitted to hospital. UA showed protein, glucose, ketones +++*

Case 2 – *A 42M present to ED severely dehydrated with fluctuating consciousness. He has recently had the flu and been experienced polyuria and polydipsia. BMI 32. BSL elevated.*

    - Chemistry
        - Hyponatraemia
            - May be secondary to urinary losses and movement of water out of cells
            - May be dilutional (pseudohyponatraemia)
        - Hyperkalaemia (however likely loss of total body K+)
            - Exchange of intracellular K+ for extracellular H+ in response to acidosis
            - Lack of insulin driving Na/K/ATPase
                - Note: giving insulin in management can precipitate hypokalaemia as a result
            - Low GFR due to pre-renal AKI, increased urinary losses
        - Hypochloridaemia
            - Vomiting losses and dilutional effect
        - Low HCO3 → metabolic acidosis
        - Hyperglycaemia (insulin deficiency)
        - High urea and creatinine (AKI (pre-renal) due to hypovolaemia and hypoperfusion)
        - High osmolality
            - Calculation: 2x Na + potassium + glucose + urea
        - High anion gap (Na - Cl - HCO3)
    - ABG
        - Acidosis
            - Low PaCO2 (respiratory compensation → hyperventilation)
            - Low HCO3 (buffer for acidic ketones)
        - Base excess (consistent with metabolic acidosis)
- Pathophysiology of T1DM
    - Complex and incompletely understood
        - Interaction between genetic predisposition (FHx, HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4) and environmental factors (e.g. infection) resulting in an inappropriate cell-mediated immune response
            - Targets B-cells of pancreas → destruction and impaired insulin production
    - Autoantibodies are demonstratable in a majority of patients however these are likely a secondary phenomenon and not primarily responsible for the damage
        - Islet cell antibodies (60-85%) → often glutamic acid decarboxylase
        - Anti-insulin Ab (60%)
- Clinical features of T1DM and DKA + pathophysiology of signs
    - Osmotic Sxs
        - Polyuria
            - Glycosuria → osmotic diuresis
        - Polydipsia
            - Dehydration triggers thirst activation via RAAS activation and osmoreceptors
            - Osmoreceptors in hypothalamus (low vol.)
        - Nocturia
    - Others
        - Blurred vision
        - N/V and abnorm pain
            - Response to metabolic acidosis (may be adaptive as vomiting reduces acid)
            - Note that the pain may be the precipitant (e.g. pancreatitis)
        - Weakness and lethargy/fatigue
            - Decreased glucose uptake in peripheral issues and brain
    - Signs
        - Weight loss (more common in T1DM)
        - Infections (eg: Candida)
        - Decreased LoC
            - Dehydration
            - Acidosis
            - High serum osmolality (glucose and ketones)
        - Ketotic fetor (ketone bodies on breath → fruity odour)
        - Other signs of hypovolaemic shock (tachycardia, hypotension)
- DKA Dx and pathophysiology
    - DKA is characterised by a diagnostic triad of:
        - Hyperglycaemia (> 11 mmol)
        - Ketoacidosis (> 0.6mmol)
        - High AGMA (pH < 7.3 or HCO3 < 15)
    - Occurs in the presence of absolute insulin deficiency and increased counter-regulatory hormone levels (e.g. catecholamines, steroids)
    - Ketone body formation
        - Mobilisation of metabolic substrates (e.g. lipolysis of TAGs, liberation of FFAs)
        - FFAs brought to liver
            - Normal metabolism involves B-oxidation within mitochondria → acetyl CoA → citrate (bound to oxaloacetate) → TCA cycle
            - Diverted to ketone body production (acetoacetate, B-hydroxybutyrate) for fuel to the brain
                - Acidic → metabolic acidosis
    - Other features
        - Hyperglycaemia → osmotic diuresis → profound dehydration, shock, AKI
        - Ketone body accumulation (exacerbated by renal failure)
            - Acidosis
            - Cerebral oedema
            - Arrhythmias
            - Death
- Pathophysiology of T2DM
    - T2DM is caused by insulin resistance
        - Initially compensated however eventual exhaustion of pancreatic B-cells leads to resultant insulin deficiency
    - Arises due to a combination of:
        - Genetic factors (strong 90% twin concordance)
        - Environmental factors (obesity, lack of physical activity, over-eating)
- Management approach to T2DM
    - Lifestyle modication (first-line)
        - Diet, exercise, weight loss, optimise CVD risk factors)
        - If failure after 3 months, consider pharmacotherapy
    - First-line
        - Metformin
    - Second-line (if glycaemic control not achieved in 3 months, add one of the following):
        - Sulphonylureas (risk of hypoglycaemia)
        - SGLT2 inhibitors
        - GLP-1 agonists
        - DPP4 inhibitors
        - Other:
            - Acarbode
            - Thiazolidinedione
            - Insulin
    - If target not achieved in 3 months, add or substitute a 3rd drug
- What is hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state? What is the pathophysiology? Clinical presentation?
    - Definition
        - A state of profound hyperglycaemia-induced dehydration with increased serum osmolallity
            - More commonly a complication of T2DM
    - Diagnostic criteria
        - Serum Osm > 320 mOsm/L
        - BSL > 33 mmol/L
        - Dehydration (elevated urea:creatinine ratio)
        - No ketoacidosis
    - Pathophysiology
        - Diabetes results in hyperglycaemia
            - Impaired insulin function results in decreased uptake of glucose into the cell via GLUT4 transporter
                - Increased GNG and glycogenolysis
        - BSL exceeds renal threshold for absorption
            - Hence, glycosuria → osmotic diuresis (water retained in tubular lumen)
        - Non-ketotic as the residual insulin in T2DM is enough to suppress lipolysis and ketogenesis but not GNG
    - Clinical presentation
        - Polyuria
        - Polydipsia
        - Decreased level of consciousness and focal neurological deficits
        - Note:
            - Less nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain due to lack of ketoacidosis (may be lactic acidosis with sustained hypoperfusion secondary to dehydration)
- Triggers for DKA and HHS
    - Caused by low levels of insulin and high levels of counter-regulatory hormones (e.g. catecholamines, steroids)
        - Insulin non-compliance or inappropriate therapy
        - First presentation of diabetes
        - Stressed states (acute illness, surgery, MI, pancreatitis)
        - Iatrogenic adrenaline, glucocorticoids, olanzapine, lithium)
    - Stressed states can precipitate hyperglycaemia as hormones (cortisol, catecholamines, glucagon) act to increase blood sugar to make metabolic fuel substrates for peripheral issues
        - In insulin deficient states → rapid hyperglycaemia
- Management approach to DKA and HHS
    - Primary survey and concurrent resuscitation
        - Admit to high acuity ward
        - Regular monitoring of BSL (hourly) and ketones (VBG) 2hourly
    - Management will reflect 4 core priorities
        - Diagnose and treat precipitating agent (e.g. dehydration, stroke, ACS, surgery, infection)
        - Haemodynamic stability
        - Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances
            - Restoration of blood volume (bolus of NaCl)
            - Potassium replacement (total body deficit despite hyperkalaemia)
                - Needs to be considered early as hypokalaemia with worsen with subsequent administration of insulin
                - If K < 5mmol, administer replacement once urine output is achieved
                - Consider administration of calcium gluconate first to stabilise the membrane
        - Acidosis
            - Correction achieved with insulin administration (suppresses lipolysis and ketogenesis)
            - Consider HCO3 replacement (via 0.45% NaCl)
                - pH < 7
                - Hypotension
                - Arrhythmia
                - Coma
        - Resolve hyperglycaemia
            - Insulin therapy
                - Do not correct glucose until K is > 3.5
                - Once BSL is < 14 mmol/L (or falling > 5mmol per hour), give concomitant glucose
            - Rehydration will aid this process as kidneys able to regulate and excrete excess glucose
    - Long-term diabetes control
- Explain changes in serum K+ levels in DKA
    - In DKA, there are increased serum levels of K+ despite a total body deficit
    - The increased serum [K] is explained by direct and indirect effects of insulin deficiency which ultimately causes decreased activity of Na/K/ATPase pump (normally, this pump exchanges Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell), secondary to decreased activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger (normally exchanges Na+ into the cell and H+ out of cell)
        - Direct insulin deficiency
            - Insulin normally stimulates the Na/H antiporter
        - Indirect acidosis
            - Extracellular H+ → inhibition of Na/H exchanger
- Compare DKA and HHS

- Complications of diabetes + pathophysiological basis
    - Complications account for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes
        - Arise due to sustained hyperglycaemia and consequences:
            - Non-enzymatic glycosylation of the vascular basement membrane
            - Intracellular sorbitol accumulation and osmotic damage
        - Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have receptor and non-receptor mediated effects
            - Receptor: bind macrophages and T cells → activate immune response and smooth muscle/matrix proliferation
                - Arteriolosclerosis
            - Non-receptor: cross-link with matrix and trap proteins and fats
                - Accelerated atherosclerosis
    - Macrovascular
        - Prolonged hyperglycaemia = accelerated atherosclerosis
            - Stroke
            - IHD
            - PVD (contributes to gangrene, ulceration, poor wound healing)
    - Microvascular
        - Thickening of capillary and arteriolar walls + increased permeability
        - Diabetic nephropathy
            - Clinical: nephrotic syndrome (high albumin in urine)
                - Proteinuria due to a change in GBM composition (loss of negative charge)
            - Histology
                - Hyaline arteriolosclerosis often present
                    - Affects afferent AND efferent arterioles (hypertensive often affects afferent only)
                - Glomerulosclerosis with mesangial hypercellularity and thickening of matrix and capillary basement membrane
                - Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions (nodular glomerulosclerosis)
                    - Ball-like deposits of pink hyaline laminated matrix
        - Diabetic neuropathy
            - Inadequacy of vasa nervorum → osmotic damage → decreased neuronal transmission
                - Peripheral neuropathy
                - Autonomic neuropathy
                - Mononeuropathy
        - Diabetic retinopathy (blurry vision, blindness)
            - Proliferative
                - Neo-vascularisation, haemorrhages and retinal damage
            - Non-proliferative
                - Infarction and macular oedema
    - Other complications
        - Cataracts
        - Impaired immune response
        - Poor wound healing
        - Recurrent UTIs (glycosuria)
- Pathophysiology of diabetic foot ulcers
    - Neuropathy
        - Sensory → failure to notice wound and adapt behaviours (continue to walk on ulcer)
        - Motor (severe cases) → joint deformities and formation of pressure wounds
        - Autonomic → reduced sweating, dry skin, compromised epithelial barrier
    - PVD → ischaemia and poor wound healing
    - Impaired immune function → poor healing

- What lifestyle modifications would you recommend for T2DM
    - Lifestyle modifications may reverse insulin resistance
        - Initiate drugs if glycaemic control is not achieved after 3 months
    - Dietary
        - Reduced saturated fats and refined sugars
        - Increase omega-3

- What glycaemic targets should patient’s aim for?
    - Aim for HbA1c < 7%
        - Can be individualised (e.g. < 6.5% in a young person on metformin, < 8% in older person at risk of hypoglycaemia)
    - Fasting BSL (4-8mmol/L)
        - May be individualised (risk of hypoglycaemia in older patients)
    - Post-prandial BSL < 10 mmol/L
- How do you monitor the effectiveness of treatment
    - Managed through an MDT (GP coordinator, endocrinology, ophthalmologist, podiatrist, dietitian, exercise physiologist, nephrologist)
        - Diabetes educator is important
        - Regular appointments with physician (GP or endocrinologist) to assess effectiveness of treatment and make adjustments to medications (frequency depends on severity and level of control)
    - Three main priorities in the monitoring of DM
        - Glycaemic control
            - Short-term
                - BSL twice daily (mane before food, and 2h post-prandial nocte)
                - Not necessary if good control
            - Long-term
                - HbA1c 3-monthly (aim < 7%)
        - Complications of diabetes
            - Retinopathy → ophthalmologist every 2 years
            - Neuropathy → examination 3 monthly

    - Biguanide oral hypoglycaemic agent → 1st line in T2DM
    - Mechanism
        - Reduces hepatic GNG (partially through inhibiting mitochondrial enzymes)
        - Increases sensitivity of peripheral issues (e.g. muscle, fat) to insulin
    - AEs
        - GI upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea)
        - Lactic acidosis (if renal dysfunction or poorly perfused tissues)

- Sulphonylureas (MOA, AEs, CI) **(2nd line agent)**
    - e.g. glipizide, gliclazide
    - Mechanism
        - Binds to ATP-sensitive K+ channel on pancreatic B cells
            - Inhibits K efflux and lowers threshold for depolarisation (with Ca influx) → increased insulin secretion
    - AEs
        - Hypoglycaemia

- Interpretation of base excess and anion gap
    - Base excess
        - Defined as the amount of strong acid which must be added to return the pH to normal
        - Interpretation
            - High = metabolic alkalosis
            - Low = metabolic acidosis
    - Anion gap
        - Anion gap represents the difference between the concentration of unmeasured anions and concentration of unmeasured cations
        - AG = Na - (Cl - HCO3) [sometimes include K+ but negligible)
            - Increased anion gap (excess H+ causes a decline in HCO3-) [KULT]
                - Ketoacidosis
                - Uraemia (or acid retention due to CKD)
                - Lactic acidosis
                - Toxins (e.g. methanol, aspirin)
            - Normal anion gap (hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis)
                - Loss of HCO3

                    - Renal tubular acidosis (type 1, 2, 4)
                    - CKD
            - Reference range (assuming K+ is normal) is 6-12 mmol/L
- Effects of acidosis on diff. organ systems?
    - Cardiac (critical effect)
        - Decreased CO and TPR
            - Competitive inhibition of slow Ca current by H+ ions
        - Arrhythmias
    - Respiratory
        - Increased respiratory drive
        - Right shift of O2-Hb curve
            - Immediate = decreased affinity (promotes O2 unloading)
                - Can become problematic in long-term due to decreased production of 2,3-DPG and increase in affinity (delays release of O2 to tissues)
    - Neurological

    - Note: Winter’s formula is important to calculate whether respiratory compensation is adequate
        - Expected PCO2 = 1.5 x [HCO3] + 8 +/- 2
            - If not equal, the patient may be decompensating and may need mechanical ventilation
- What is C-peptide
    - Cleaved from pro-insulin in the final stages of insulin synthesis
    - Useful in two clinical contexts:
        - New diagnosis of T1DM (surrogate marker of residual B-cell function
        - Hypoglycaemia in the setting of excess insulin (can distinguish between exogenous and endogenous)
