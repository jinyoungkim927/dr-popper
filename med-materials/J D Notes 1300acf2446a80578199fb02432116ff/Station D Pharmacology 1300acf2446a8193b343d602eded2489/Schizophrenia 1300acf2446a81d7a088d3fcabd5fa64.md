# Schizophrenia

## Case Protocol 45 – **Schizophrenia**

***Case:** A 23yo man with 15mo history of paranoid-type schizophrenia presents for review by his GP. He is currently prescribed 25mg of clozapine daily. He has been compliant with his medication for over 4mo and has remained stable in the community. Before clozapine, he had previously been prescribed quetiapine for over 5mo and more recently risperidone for 6mo, but both of those drugs failed to improve his positive psychotic symptoms. Results of a routine non-fasting blood test revealed that he had normal neutrophil levels, clozapine was in therapeutic range, liver and kidney function was normal. However, non-fasting blood glucose level was high at 10.2mmol/L. On exam, BP and HR were within normal range. He had previously maintained stable weight of 80kg but has gained 15kg in the past 4mo. He generally feels well but is concerned by his increase in weight.*

***Case:***

*A 35yo male with schizophrenia has been treated in the past with quetiapine and risperidone. The patient is now being considered for clozapine.*

        - Manage
            - Comorbid substance abuse
            - Comorbid medical illnesses
    - Pharmacological
        - Antipsychotics are effective - take 2-4 weeks for maximal effect
            - Continue treatment to prevent relapse
                - First episode psychosis: usually 1-2 years
                - Multiple episodes: may need prolonged treatment
                    - Monitor adverse effects
                    - Consider slow-release forms (depots) to aid compliance
            - Start low dose and rise slowly to initial target dose over 4 weeks (uptitration)
            - When ceasing treatment, taper off
                - Hence, if starting new agent → cross tapering (decrease one, increase another)
        - 1st line
            - Second generation antipsychotic (PO) [e.g. aripiprazole, amisulpride, quetiapine, risperidone)
                - Avoid clozapine and olanzapine first-line due to AE profile
                - Increase dose if no response over next 4-6 weeks despite good compliance and lack of complicating factors (e.g. substance abuse)
            - Adjuvant anxiolytics (agitation) or antidepressants (affective component)
        - 2nd line
            - Change antipsychotics if there is no response after 6 weeks at adequate dosing and no
        - Treatment resistant
            - Clozapine (most effective - significant side effects)
            - ECT
            - Combination antipsychotic therapy
- Compare typical and atypical antipsychotics
    
    
    |  | Typical (1st Gen) | Atypical (Second) and Third Gen |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | First line | No | Yes (more effective, safe, less AEs) |
    | Examples | High potency (haloperidol, droperidol); low potency (chlorpromazine) | Second Gen (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine); Third Gen (amisulpride, aripiprazole) |
    | MOA | High affinity D2 receptor antagonism (reduced positive effects). Note: chlorpromazine has anticholinergic and antihistamine effects  | Lower affinity D2; high affinity serotonin (5HT2A) and other receptor antagonism. Better management of negative symptoms and reduced EPS |
    | Effectiveness | Only manages positive psychotic symptoms. Strong sedating effect (high potency) | Manages both negative and positive symptoms |
    | Risks | Low safety profile | Better safety profile (harder to OD) |
    | AEs | More EPS (blockade of dopamine in nigrostriatal pathway), ocular effects | Less EPS (5HT and variable dopamine affinity); more metabolic and anticholinergic effects, sedation and somnolence (via H1 blockade); clozapine can cause agranulocytosis and cardiotoxicity |

- When is clozapine used and what are its side effects?
    - Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for treatment resistant schizophrenia (unresponsive disease or patient intolerant to other antipsychotics (e.g. severe EPSE))
        - Should be for patients who have failed adequate trials of ≥ 2 alternative antipsychotic drugs at maximum appropriate therapeutic dose (for 4-6 weeks each) OR due to severe side effects
    - Rationale is to ensure a favourable risk-benefit ratio in the context of clozapine’s uncommon but life-threatening side effects
        - Agranulocytosis (loss of **neutrophils**, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells)
            - Severe neutropenia = infection risk
        - Arrhythmias (prolonged QT)
        - Cardiomyopathy and myocarditis
        - GI hypomotility → can lead to obstruction
        - High risk of severe metabolic syndrome and weight gain
        - Lowers seizure threshold
        - Risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome
    - Can augment clozapine with alternative agent (SSRI - fluvoxamine, SGA, mood stabiliser)
- How do you start clozapine treatment? How do you monitor the side effects?
    - Initiating treatment
        - Start low dose
            - 12.5-25mg, increase by 25-50mg daily up to 300mg/day at 2-3 weeks
            - If non-compliant, there is a risk of rebound psychosis and you must retitrate the dose from the initial low dose
        - If the patient smokes, a larger dose may be needed (smoking enhances clozapine metabolism)
    - Monitoring side effects
        - General physical monitoring
            - Vitals (HR, RR, BP, temperature) → weekly for 4 weeks, then 3 monthly
        - Cardiac
            - Troponins → weekly for 4 weeks, then 6 monthly
            - ECG → baseline, week 4, annually
            - Echo → as needed
        - Haematological
            - FBC and differential (include ANC)
                - Weekly for first 18 weeks then monthly
                    - If dose is changed, restart weekly
        - Metabolic
            - Weight, waist circumference, BMI
                - Monthly for first 6 months, then 3 monthly
            - Fasting lipids (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, TGs) and fasting glucose
                - 3 monthly for 1 year, 6 monthly for remainder
            - HbA1c → annual unless diabetic, then 3 monthly
            - UECs and LFTs → 6 monthly
- How might this man’s treatment affect his blood glucose levels
    - Atypical antipsychotics act on a wide range of neuroreceptors alongside D2 antagonism
        - E.g. affect serotonergic and histaminergic signalling which may contribute to metabolic syndrome
    - Effects
        - Hyperglycaemia → block insulin release from pancreas
        - Weight gain and dyslipidaemia → block effects of the reward pathways (complex, include sertonin) and eating does not provide adequate satiety
    - Note: antipsychotics ending in ‘pine’ have high risk
        - Clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine
        - Aripiprazole has lowest risk (greatest benefit in younger patients)
- What further tests would you order to investigate this man’s high non-fasting blood glucose?
    - Random blood glucose normally 3.0 < x < 7.8
        - Diagnostic for diabetes if > 11.1mmol/L
    - Need investigations licensed to investigate and diagnose glucose abnormalities
        - Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c are cheaper and less time-consuming (preferred initial test)
            - If in the diabetic range on 2 separate occasions, diabetes can be diagnosed without OGTT
            - If symptomatic and 1 abnormal test, diabetes can be diagnosed
            - If normal or in a pre-diabetic level, OGTT is needed
    
    |  | Normal | Pre-Diabetes | Diabetes |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Fasting blood glucose | 3.0 < x < 5.6 | 5.6 - 6.9 | ≥ 7.0 |
    | 2-hour OGTT | < 7.8 | 7.8-11.0 | ≥ 11.1 |
    | HBA1c | < 5.7% | 5.7-6.4% | ≥ 6.5% |

- How does quetiapine (Seroquel) compare to other agents?
    - Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic
    - Compared to typical
        - Less likely to cause EPSE
    - Compared to other atypicals
        - High risk of metabolic syndrome (less than olanzapine or clozapine)
        - High risk of anticholinergic effects (similar to clozapine, olanzapine)
        - High rate of sedation (can be used as a sleep aid in low dose)
- How does olanzapine compare to other agents
    - More likely to have:
        - Metabolic effects
        - Anticholinergic effects
        - Orthostatic hypotension
        - Thermoregulatory abnormalities
- Review genes and neurotransmitter causes in schizophrenia
    - DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1)
    - Neuregulin 1 (NRG1)
        - Involved in glutamate signalling and brain development
    - Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
    - Abnormalities in multiple neurotransmitters
        - Dopamine, serotonin, a-adrenergic hyperactivity
            - Dopamine hypothesis
                - Excess D2 receptor activation in mesolimbic pathway = positive symptoms
                - Low mesocortical dopamine = negative symptoms
        - Glutamate and GABA hypoactivity
- Why is clozapine so effective for schizophrenia
    - Dopamine antagonist (weak D2 effects, high D4 affinity)
        - High affinity to serotonin receptors, a1 and a2 receptors, H1 receptors and M1-M5 receptors
            - High AE profile due to action on multiple receptors
    - Effectiveness as an antipsychotic thought to be due to its relatively rapid dissociation from D2 receptors and 5HT-2A antagonism
