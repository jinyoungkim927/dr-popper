# Post-operative analgesia

An 80-year-old man comes in for a hemi-colectomy. He has biventricular heart failure. After the operation, he complains about abdominal pain. His pain medications are charted as below: 

- Morphine IM q8h
- Paracetamol PO
- Ondansetron PO
- Morphine PRN

- What is wrong with his charted medications?
    - Morphine IM Q8h and PRN
        - Issues
            - IM route is slower with more variable absorption
                - Less effective and increased time for pain relief
                - Painful to administer repeated IM injections
            - PRN is inferior to PCA and increased time for patient to receive pain relief
            - Constipation risk
                - Consider adding movicol (osmotic laxative but NO promotility drugs)
                    - Promotility drugs (e.g. senna) are contraindicated in bowel surgery as increased peristalsis leads to poorer outcomes and pain
        - How should it be corrected?
            - Morphine IV immediately post-op followed by morphine PCA
                - 1-2mg IV boluses every 5 mins until satisfactory relief
                - Follow with PCA (patient controlled analgesia)
                    - Allows patient to self-administer small fixed doses of analgesia as required
                - Set parameters such as:
                    - Bolus dose (e.g. 1mg morphine)
                    - Lockout time (often 5 mins to allow time for previous dose to take effect)
            - Advantages of PCA
                - Reduces breakthrough pain, nausea and drowsiness
                    - Avoids peaks and troughs in morphine plasma concentration
                - Patient in control as they are the best judge of their own pain
    - Paracetamol PO
        - Issues
            - Cannot administer PO medications as the patient has recently had abdominal surgery and may have paralytic ileus
            - Should be administered regularly as opposed to PRN whilst intensity of pain is moderate-high
        - How should it be corrected?
            - Dose 1g QID (max dose of 4g/24h)
            - IV paracetamol should be used as it is opioid sparing and may reduce opioid requirements
                - Multimodal therapy allows lowering of opioid dose and reduced AEs
    - Ondansetron IM
        - How should it be corrected
            - Give IV
            - Preferred over metoclopromide post-bowel surgery as it does not have prokinetic effects
- What is the gold standard for post-operative analgesia
    - Multimodal analgesia which is opioid sparing where possible
        - Use a step-wise system to escalate analgesia where necessary
    - Paracetamol 1g QID IV
        - Shown to reduce opioid use and can use PO if no vomiting
        - NSAIDs may be used in conjunction if there are no contraindications
    - Opioids
        - Any opioids can be used as long as the dose is titrated
            - IV boluses at 5 mins intervals until satisfactory pain relief
            - Follow with PCA
        - Must monitor with sedation score (more sensitive than respiratory rate for respiratory depression)
    - Consider adjuvants:
        - Laxative or stool softener
            - Prescribe with opioids (movicol preferred → hyperosmotic)
            - Lactulose can also be chosen (poor taste)
        - Anti-emetics (e.g. ondansetron)
- Paracetamol (MOA, AE, overdose)
    - Mechanism
        - Inhibits production of prostaglandins via AA pathway (unclear mechanism)
            - Analgesia
                - Modulates descending inhibitory pathways
            - Antipyretic
                - Reduced production of PGE in the hypothalamus
    - AEs
        - Hepatic necrosis
            - Toxic metabolite NAPQI depletes glutathione and increases oxidative stress and damage in the liver
        - Rash
        - Anaemia, leukopaenia, neutropaenia
    - Management in overdose
        - Activated charcoal in recent ingestions (<2h)
        - N-acetylcysteine regenerates glutathione
- Why is paracetamol monotherapy not suitable as an analgesic
    - Paracetamol is not a suitable monotherapy for severe pain as it is a weak analgesic
    - Useful in combination therapy to require opioid requirements
- Compare paracetamol and NSAIDs as analgesia
    - Efficacy
        - Both shown to be opioid sparing
        - Similar analgesic effects (NSAIDs slightly syperior)
    - Safety
        - Paracetamol has a better AE profile
        - NSAIDs are less favourable (renal impairment, GI bleeding, thrombotic risk)
    - Note:
        - These agents may be used synergistically
        - Paracetamol should be used routinely as 1g QID
            - NSAIDs require assessment of each patient individually
- Contraindications for NSAIDs (in this patient, general)
    - Avoid NSAIDs in this patient due to:
        - GI side effects with recent abdominal surgery
        - Bleeding risk (antiplatelet effect)
        - Patient has heart failure → risk of further decompensation secondary to fluid retention
    - Absolute contraindications
        - Known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs
        - Asthma sensitive to NSAIDs (bronchospasm)
        - Active GI bleeding
        - Pregnant (teratogenic, closure of DA)
    - Relative contraindications
        - History of GI haemorrhage or PUD
        - Hepatic, renal or cardiac impairment
        - Asthma
- COX 2 inhibitors (benefits compared to non-selective NSAIDs)
    - COX-2 selective (e.g. celecoxib) were developed to provide less inhibition of COX1 constitutional effects
    - Benefits
        - Similar efficacy for analgesia, anti-inflammatory, anti-[yretic
        - Reduced AEs
            - Less GI upset and PUD
            - Less bronchospasm
            - Less bleeding risk
    - AEs (COX2)
        - Cardiac
            - Increased risk of MI, heart failure, stroke
            - Potential pro-thrombotic events
        - **Renal**
            - Interstitial nephritis
- Morphine (mechanism, AE)
    - Mechanism
        - **Agonist at GPCR opioid receptors** (mu, kappa, delta)
            - Mu
                - Analgesia
                - Respiratory depression, mioisis
                - Constipation
                - Euphoria, dependence
            - Delta
                - Analgesia, respiratory depression, euphoria
            - Kappa
                - Analgesia, miosis, dysphoria, sedation
        - Effects of receptor binding
            - Inhibits adenylyl cyclase and neurotransmitter release
                - Reduced intracellular cAMP and hyperpolarisation of neurons
            - Results in closure of presynaptic Ca channels and opening of post-synaptic K channels
                - Decreases synaptic transmission (ACh, NA, 5-HT, glutamate, substance P) and inhibition of ascending nociceptive signals
                - Potentiates descending inhibitor impulses

        - **Nausea and vomiting**
        - Euphoria
        - **Sedation**
    - Manage overdose with naloxone (IM)
        - Opioid receptor antagonist with short half-life (1h) which rapidly reverses effects
- What factors would you consider for opioid use? (APO, post-operative analgesia)
    - patient factors
        - preference
        - prev opioids dependence → may have tolerance, need higher dose for effect
        - drug seeking behaviour
    - clinical factors
        - WHO pain ladder
        - co-morbidities
        - side effects
- Why is morphine a good choice for post-operative analgesia? Route of administration?
    - Several factors support the use of morphine
    - Pragmatic factors
        - Cheap and widely available
        - Familiar to many clinicians
    - Pharmacological
        - Full agonist at opioid receptors → good efficacy
        - Various routes of administration
            - IV
                - Rapid onset and good for short term use
            - IM
                - Generally avoided due to irregular absorption and more painful
            - Subcutaneous
                - Equally effective to IM
                - Less painful
- Morphine use in CKD
    - Morphine should not be used in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease
        - Alternatives include fentanyl (no dose reduction required) or oxycodone/hydromorphone (dose reduction required)
        - Risk of accumulating active metabolites and toxicity (sedation, confusion, myoclonus, respiratory depression)
    - What other opioids would you give if low renal function
        - Consider fentanyl or oxycodone
            - Oxycodone preferred in renal impairment with adjusted dose
            - Fentanyl metabolised in liver → no active or toxic metabolite accumulation
- How do you minimise the risk of AEs with morphine
    - Multimodal analgesia
        - E.g. paracetamol, NSAIDs to reduce opioid requirement
    - IV boluses followed with PCA (with lockout periods)
    - Monitor sedation with a validated tool
- What are the different types of opioids
    - Strong opioids
        - Oxycodone (1.5x)
        - Hydromorphine (5x)

            - NA reuptake inhibition
    - Partial agonists
        - Buprenorphine
- Ondansetron (MOA, AE)
    - Used in cancer chemotherapy and post-operative nausea and vomiting
    - Mechanism
        - 5-HT3 antagonist
            - Centrally acting antiemetic
                - Acts on chemoreceptor trigger zone (area postrema) in medulla
            - Peripheral effect
                - Decreases vagal stimulation to the vomiting centre in medulla (reflex)
    - AEs
        - Headache
        - Constipation
        - QT interval prolongation
        - Risk of serotonin syndrome?
- If the patient was IVDU, how would this change your approach
    - Suggests that the patient may have acquired a tolerance and would require a higher dose of opioid therapy
        - Concerns about withdrawal
    - Management
        - Consult a pain specialist
        - Options for analgesia
            - PCA with maintenance infusion
            - Suboxone (buprenorphine + naloxone) may reverse opioid induced hyperalgesia
                - Consider risk of precipitated withdrawal
        - Contact opioid substitution program coordinator if involved
        - Monitor for withdrawal
            - Pupil dilation
            - Sweating, tachycardia
            - Diarrhoea
        - Monitor for drug seeking behaviour
- How would you manage an overdose
    - Paracetamol
        - If ≤ 4h, consider activated charcoal or NAC
        - If 4-8h
            - Check serum paracetamol level
            - Consider NAC based on result
        - ≥ 8h
            - Start NAC immediately and check serum paracetamol level
        - Monitor LFTs, coags, UEC, lactate
    - NSAIDs
        - Minimal clinical manifestations
        - Supportive care
    - Opioids
        - Sedation, miosis, respiratory depression
        - Primary survey and concurrent assessment and management
            - Oxygenation
            - IV fluids if hypotensive
        - Definitive: naloxone
- What one organ would you examine if the patient was unconscious
    - Eye → pupillary constriction
- WHO principles of pain management
    - “By the clock, by the mouth, by the ladder”
        - By the clock
            - Drugs given regularly as opposed to only PRN to optimise analgesia
        - By the mouth
            - PO route preferred where possible
            - Least invasive route should be considered if PO no possible
                - e.g. subcutaneous before IV
            - Avoid IM
        - By the ladder
            - Stepwise escalation of analgesia
                - Non-opioids
                - Mild opioids (codeine), atypicals (tramadol, tapentadol)
                - Strong opioids
            - Drug selection should be appropriate to the severity of the pain
                - Maintain patient on the dose which is effective
    - Adjuvants
        - Antidepressants (amitriptyline, duloxetine)
            - Strengthen inhibitor pathways (inhibit monoamine reuptake)
            - First line in neuropathic pain, useful in chronic pain
        - Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin)
            - Block Ca channels to modulate Ca influx into hyperexcitable neurons and reduce release of excitatory AAs
            - First line in neuropathic pain, can be used perioperatively
        - Corticosteroids
            - Inhibit AA pathway and pain relief

- Dopamine antagonists as anti-emetics
    - e.g. metoclopromide (Maxolon), prochlorperazine (Stemetil)
        - Prochlorperazine used for mild to moderate chemotherapy induced nausea
            - Moderately effective
        - Metoclopromide has central and peripheral D2 action
    - Mechanism
        - Antagonises D2 receptors
        - Metoclopromide stimulates ACh receptors on gastric smooth muscle (enhanced release) which increases gastric emptying
            - Peripheral action
    - AE
        - Risk of extrapyramidal reactions with prolonged use (dystonia, TD)
        - Anxiety, restless, depression
        - Hyperprolactinaemia
    - CI
        - Pro-kinetic agent and inappropriate for use in post-GI surgery
- Compare fentanyl and morphine (pharm, half-life)
    - Fentanyl
        - 50-100x more potent than morphine
            - Rapid onset of action due to fast tissue uptake
        - **Hepatic metabolism (CYP)**
            - Shorter half-life (30-60mins)
    - Morphine half life
        - 2-3 hours
