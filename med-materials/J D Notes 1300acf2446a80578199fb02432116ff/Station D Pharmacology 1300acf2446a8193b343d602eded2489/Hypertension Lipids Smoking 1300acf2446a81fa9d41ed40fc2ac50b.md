### Memorandum: Pharmacology

**Case:**

*A 44 year old man of Torres Strait Islander origin presents to his GP. He has a blood pressure of 160/90, he has a total cholesterol of 6.1 and a HDL of 1.0. He smokes 20 cigarettes a day, and plays touch footy once a week.*

- How do you assess absolute CVD risk
    - Absolute risk charts are helpful tools to assess the probability that a patient will develop a cardiovascular event within 5 years
        - Low: < 10%
        - Moderate: 10-15%
        - High: ≥ 15%
    - Based on:
        - Diabetes status
        - Sex: Men or Women
        - Age bracket (35-44 → 65-74)
        - Smoker or non-smoker
        - Total cholesterol:HDL ratio
        - Systolic blood pressure
- Who should have their absolute CVD risk estimated
    - Testing criteria (every 2 years)
        - All adults aged ≥ 45
        - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults ≥ 35
    - No need to calculate risk if they already have known high absolute-risk factors
        - Established cardiovascular disease
        - Diabetes aged ≥ 60
        - Familial hypercholesterolaemia
        - BP ≥ 180mmHg
        - Moderate to severe CKD
- Dx approach to HTN
- How would you treat each px health issues
    - Patient has a low absolute CVD risk (5-9%)
    - Non-pharmacological management
        - Smoking cessation
            - Motivational interviewing with a 5A’s approach (ask, assess, advise, assist, arrange)
        - Diet and lifestyle modification for rate control
            - DASH diet (approach to stop hypertension) → cut salt, fat, oils, sugars → encourage wholegrains, vegetables, fruit, lean meat or fish
            - Regular exercise routine and avoid sedentary behaviours
        - Reduce alcohol intake (<4 SDs for a single day, < 10 SDs for a week)
    - Pharmacological
        - Blood pressure
        - Cholesterol
        - Smoking cessation
- Principles of HTN management
    - Lifestyle modifications
        - Physical activity (30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity on most days)
        - Smoking cessation
        - Weight loss
            - Target waist measurement and central adiposity (men < 94cm, women < 80cm)
            - BMI < 25
        - Dietary salt restriction ≤ 4g/day
        - Limiting alcohol intake
    - First-line monotherapy **(set BP target and assess for adverse effects and adherence)**
        - ACE inhibitors or ARBs
        - CCB (dihydropyridine)
        - Thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics
    - Combination therapy and rationale
        - Only 20-30% of patients will be adequately controlled on monotherapy and lifestyle modifications
        - If BP targets have not be reached after 3 months, add a low-dose of second drug (different class)
            - If both tolerated and target not met, increase the dose of one of the two drugs AND then the other
            - If still above target, consider potential reasons (non-adherence, secondary causes of HTN)
                - Add a third agent if no plausible reasons found
        - Combinations
            - RAAS block + thiazide (esp. in CCF, post-stroke or elderly)
            - RAAS block + dCCB (diabetes or HC)
            - dCCB and B-blocker (CHD or post MI)
            - RAAS + dCCB + thiazide
    - BP targets
        - Individualised to patient and base on risk of future cardiovascular events v. risk of adverse effects
        - Examples
            - In patients with established atherosclerotic CVD (< 125-130 SBP)
            - In patients > 75, high comorbidities, postural hypertension (< 135-140 SBP)
- ARNs
    - E.g. candesartan, valsartan, losartan, irbesartan
    - Mechanism
        - Bind and antagonist ATII receptors
            - Decreased aldosterone release (Na and H2O excretion, K retention)
            - Decreased ADH release (water excretion)
            - Decreased AngII mediated vasoconstriction
            - Decrease GFR
        - No effects on bradykinin
    - Side effects (POPR)
        - Potassium levels increase
        - Orthostatic hypotension (first dose hypotension)
        - Pregnancy contraindicated
        - Renal failure in renal artery stenosis (bilateral)
    - CI: pregnancy, renal artery stenosis
- CCBs
    - Dihydropyridine
        - E.g. amlodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine
        - Mechanism
            - Inhibits voltage dependent L-type calcium channel (more specific for vascular smooth muscle than cardiac)
                - Leads to peripheral vasodilation and decreased TPR and BP
        - Indications: hypertension, angina, Raynaud’s, post SAH to prevent vasospasm, hypertensive emergency
        - AE
            - Vasodilatory → peripheral oedema, flushing, dizziness, headache
        - Use with caution in elderly with haemodynamic instability (especially if on diuretics)
    - Non-dihydropyridine
        - E.g. verapamil, diltiazem (not first-line for HTN)
        - Mechanism
            - Blocks voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (greater preference for cardiac muscle) → decrease contractility, HR and TPR → decreased CO and BP
        - Indications: angina, fibrillation or flutter, hypertension
        - AE
            - Cardiac: bradycardia, AV block
            - Other: dizziness, flushing, headache, constipation
        - Contraindicated in severe heart dysfunction, sick sinus syndrome
- Thiazide diuretics
    - E.g. hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone
    - Mechanism
        - Blocks Na/Cl cotransporter in the DCT
            - Increased water excretion and reduced preload (decrease CO and TPR)
    - AE
        - Hyponatraemia
        - Hypokalaemia
        - Hypotension
        - **Hyperglycaemia**
        - **Hyperuricaemia**
    - Contraindicated in gout, diabetes, renal impairment, hypotension, age < 65
- K-sparing diuretics
    - e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone
    - Mechanism
        - Competitive antagonist at mineralocorticoid receptor in cortical collecting tubules
        - Antagonises aldosterone → reduces Na and H2O absorption (and K and H excretion)
    - AE
        - Hyperkalaemia
        - Metabolic acidosis
        - Can cause anti-androgenic effects (gynaecomastia, impotence)
    - Contraindications
        - Hyperkalaemia, renal failure
        - Pregnancy
- Central-acting antiHTNsives
    - Alpha-2 agonists (e.g. methyldopa, clonidine)
        - Not first-line except in hypertension of pregnancy
        - Mechanism
            - Stimulates pre-synaptic a2 receptors (reduced peripheral catecholamines and SNS activity) → decreased TPR
        - AE
            - Drowsiness, dry mouth
- Hydralazine
    - Mechanism
        - Arterial vasodilation (mechanism contentious)
            - Possibly smooth muscle relaxation through increasing NO production and causing smooth muscle hyperpolarisation (inhibits Ca influx)
    - AE
        - Vasodilation related → headache, flushing
        - Reflex SNS stimulation → tachycardia, fluid retention
- How do ACEi + spironolactone ⇒ hyperkalaemia? Loop and thiazide causing hypokalaemia?
    - ACEi and spironolactone
        - Reduce aldosterone production or antagonise it and thus prevent K excretion in exchange for Na reabsorption
        - Hyperkalaemia
    - Loop and thiazide diuretics
        - Natriuresis and increase Na load at the DCT
            - Triggers the activity of Na/K exchangers which can decrease K (hypokalaemia)
- Notable contraindications in anti-hypertensives
    - Thiazide diuretics (diabetes, age < 65, gout, pregnancy)
    - ACEi or ARB (renal artery stenosis, pregnancy)
    - B-blockers or nCCB (AV block, caution in CCF)
    - Avoid ACEi or ARB and spironolactone (risk of hyperkalaemia)
- Hypertensive crisis/emergency
    - Urgency = severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 180, DBP ≥ 120) without acute end-organ damage
    - Emergency = severe hypertension with signs of end-organ damage
        - CNS → encephalopathy, ICH, stroke
        - Eyes - retinopathy
        - CVS - acute coronary syndrome
        - Resp - APO
        - Kidney - AKI
    - Management
        - Reduce BP by max 25% in first hour (caution around reducing cerebral perfusion)
            - Aim for 160/110 in first 2-6 hours
            - Return patient to baseline in 24-48h
        - Drugs
            - CCB
            - NO dependent vasodilators (sodium nitroprusside)
            - Direct arterial vasodilators (hydralazine)
            - Anti-adrenergic drugs (esmolol, phentolamine)
- Pathophysiology of HTN-related damage
    - Systemic complications mostly related to pathological vascular changes
        - Arterio(lo)sclerosis
            - Hyaline
                - Thickening of walls and luminal narrowing
                - Leaking of plasma components across injured endothelium into the vessel wall leads to ECM deposition by smooth muscle cells
            - Hyperplastic
                - Concentric laminated thickening of arteriolar walls and luminal narrowing often caused by acute severe hypertension
        - Accelerated atherosclerosis
    - Results in end organ complications
        - Cardiac → LVH and heart failure
        - Brain → stroke (lacunar infarcts, ICH), vascular dementia, stroke
        - Eye → hypertensive retinopathy
        - Kidneys → CKD (hypertensive nephrosclerosis)
        - PVD, AAA, aortic dissection
        - GUT → mesenteric ischaemia
- Management of hypertension in pregnancy
    - Indicated if BP > 140/90
    - Note that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated (foetal cardiac and renal abnormalities)
    - Preferred (Mum Loves No Hypertension)
        - Methyldopa (a2 agonist to reduce peripheral catecholamines)
        - Labetalol (alpha and B adrenergic antagonism)
        - Nifedipine (dCCB)
        - Hydralazine (smooth muscle relaxant)

**Lipids and Smoking**

- Pathophysiological changes in the blood vessel walls from cigarette smoking
    - Sympathetic activation → increased HR and vasoconstriction
    - Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in coronary arteries
        - ROS reacts with NO (decreased bioavailability and production)
    - Increased inflammation and pro-thrombotic state
        - Inhibition of tPA release from endothelium
        - Increased platelet activity
        - Increased expression of tissue factor
        - Smooth muscle proliferation in vessel wall
        - Elevated blood fibrinogen concentration

            - Stimulates mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system
            - Inhibits monoamine oxidase inhibitor (normally metabolises catecholamines)
        - Reinforced behaviour through social conditioning and paired with other actions (drinking coffee or alcohol)
    - Tolerance
        - Sustained use leads to neuroadaptation for nicotine stimulation → increasing doses needed to achieve the same effect
    - Withdrawal
        - Without nicotine, patients experience mood disorders, irritability, restlessness, anxiety, difficulty concentrating
- Treatments for smoking cessation
    - Non-pharmacological
        - MI
        - Psychology assistance and counselling
        - Support services → Quitline
    - Pharmacological

            - Gives measured amounts of nicotine to eventually reduce a person’s dependence
            - Prevents withdrawal Sxs
        - Varenicline
            - MOA

Case: 

36 years ago – Laura aged 30.
Laura Anderson is a 30-year-old woman who visits a new GP for checkup, having
just moved from another state to take up a job as market researcher for a large
company.
Her mother is alive at age 52 and has just been diagnosed with **type 2 diabetes,**
and her father died in a motor vehicle accident when she was a teenager.
**She smokes 10-15 cigarettes** a day and is physically active, playing tennis twice a week
and enjoying bushwalking most weekends. She doesn’t tend to drink during the week,
but often has **5-6 standard drinks of beer and wine on Friday and Saturday nights.**
**On examination:**
General appearance: Well-looking, relaxed.
Height 1.65m, Weight 70kg, BMI 26
Waist circumference 82cm
Heart rate: 72/min
Blood pressure: 128/86

- Would you want to have it >80 
Respiratory rate: 10/min

Questions:  

1. What factors increase lauras cardio vascular risk: 
    1. Smoking 
    2. Alc Levels : safe standards: 8 standards per week for women , 10 for males 
        1. No more than 4 per occuasion   
    
    c. Waist Circumeference: 80 cm 
    
     d. fmhx 
    
2. What follow ups are indicated? Use the CVD risk calculator (anyone sarting at 30 yo)   , look at a lipid panel—> look for dyslipidemia, do bp again after 10 mins, more extensive bp monitoring 0 ambulatory -doing it at home , long term monitoring at home. Lifestyle modification, 
3. What pathophysiological changes occur in the blood and vessel walls in repose to cigarrete smoking: how reversible are these? 
    1. — Sympathetic activation leading to increased heart rate and vasoconstriction
    — Impairs endothelium dependent vasodilation in coronary arteries
    — Increased inflammation and associated prothrombotic state – elevates fibrinogen concentration, increases platelet activity, increases tissue factor
    — Damage to vascular wall – Promotes the development, progression and rupture of atherosclerosis

**15 years later:** 

*Fifteen years later – Laura at age 45.
Laura has been very successful in her career and is now the Marketing Manager, which
is a responsible and stressful position. She is smoking 20-30 cigarettes a day and does
not have time for regular exercise. Her mother died 6 months ago from a heart attack
at age 67. She has unsuccessfully been trying to lose weight for the past 2 years, with
intermittent loss of 5- 6 kg that is soon regained.*

At this stage would u consider: 

5. Why do people gain weight? What biochemical/physiological processes occur during weight gain and dieting? What is the role of exercise? 

1. . 
2. 

6. What are the causes of high blood pressure?

- Secondary Causes:
    - renal artery stenosis: hypo-perfusion - retaining water, cushings - excerbation of cortisol, hyper aldesteronism, c___ of the aorta, adrenal tumour, sleep apnoea, pregnancy
- Primary: idiopathic bit we know things conrib
    - Metabolic effect of excess weight
    - General increase in body mass → alter vasomotor tone
    - high levels of stress → remodelling in th e long term
    - Essential hypertension as ppl get older

7. What is impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance? What
medicines are available for impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes? How do they
work?

impaired fasting glcyaemia: 6.1 -6.9 

Imparied glucose tolerance: 7.8-11 , 11.1 and greater is diabetic  

Dash diet ,owering salt , meiteranian diet 

Fifteen years on – Laura at 60.
After her mother’s death, Laura left her firm and started work as an independent Marketing
Consultant and has been highly successful. She stopped smoking at age 46 after help from
her GP but still has no time for regular exercise, and she has put on more weight since and
has become hypertensive. She takes an ACE inhibitor once daily for her high blood pressure.
A few days ago, she noticed some chest discomfort when she was hurrying upstairs at the
opera house when she was late for a concert. It settled when she was resting in her seat
and has not returned, but she has been careful not to exert herself. Further history tends to
exclude non-cardiac causes of chest pain.
