# Colonic polyp

## SPIEL

- I observed the cut-up of a colonic polyp that was removed from the sigmoid colon by colonoscopy from a 70M who presented with a positive iFOBT and change in bowel habit
- Macroscopic
    - Intact polyp received in formalin
        - Measured 15mm with a 3mm stalk
    - The polyp was pedunculated (lobular head with a slender stalk)
    - Smooth mucosal velvety surface with ulceration and signs of haemorrhage
    - The specimen was bisected and embedded
        - The cut surface was inked.
- Microscopic
    - Architecture
        - Tubular adenoma with moderate differentiation
            - Fibrous desmoplastic response noted
            - Ulceration of epithelium and haemorrhage
        - Abnormal cells were confined to the mucosa (did not extend beyond muscularis mucosa or propria)
    - Cellular
        - Tall columnar cells representing severely dysplastic glandular cells of the colonic mucosa
        - Features of neoplasia evident
            - Hyperchromatic nuclei
            - Multiple mitotic figures
            - Increased nuclei:cytoplasm ratio
            - Pleomorphism
- Significance
    - Colonic adenoma demonstrating signs of neoplasia
        - Confined to mucosa
    - **High-risk conventional adenoma with high grade dysplasia**
        - **Patient should undergo surveillance colonoscopy in 3 years**

- Pathogenesis of colonic adenoma
    - Colorectal carcinoma are malignant neoplasms arising from the epithelium of the colon or rectum → majority are adenocarcinoma
        - There are two pathways
    - Adenoma-carcinoma sequence (APC/B-cateinin)
        - Accounts for 80% of sporadic CRC
            - Often tubular or tubulovillous adenocarcinomas
        - Sequence:
            - Two hits to APC tumour suppressor gene (germline/somatic + somatic)
            - Loss of negative regulation of B-catenin and accumulation of B-catenin
                - Proliferation and adenoma formation
            - Accumulation of other mutations (KRAS → proto-oncogene; p53)
                - Further proliferation, apoptosis resistance, dysregulated signalling, dysplasia
                - Results in carcinoma
    - DNA mismatch repair pathway (accounts for 20% of CRC)
        - Often sessile serrated adenocarcinomas
        - Sequence:
            - Germline (small minority → HNPCC) or somatic mutation in repair pathways **(e.g. MSH2, MSH6)**
            - Microsatellite instability and accumulation of further mutations
                - Genetic hypermutability
            - If mutations occur in regions which promote proliferation OR suppress apoptosis OR result in dysregulated signalling
                - Cancer
            
- Complications
    - Conversion of adenoma to adenocarcinoma and CRC
    - Local
        - **Bleeding** → iron deficiency anaemia
        - **Bowel obstruction** → third spacing (shock), perforation, peritonitis, sepsis
        - Malabsorption → fluid and electrolyte imbalances
        - **Fistula** (e.g. vesicorectal)
    - Disseminated
        - Metastases → lung, liver, bone, brain
    - Systemic
        - Cachexia
        - VTE and PE
        - DIC
- How do you stage CRC
    - TNM staging system (correlates with Duke’s A-D)
        - Stage 1
            - T1 (submucosa) or T2 (muscularis propria)
        - Stage 2
            - T3 or T4 (invades beyond propria and invades other organs or structures)
        - Stage 3
            - Any T
            - N1 or N2 (regional LNs)
        - Stage 4
            - M1 (distant)
- Common methods of spread for CRC
    - Local spread
        - Depends on the location of the original tumour
            - May involve pelvic organs (e.g. uterus, prostate, urinary bladder)
    - Lymphatic spread
        - SMA or IMA nodal drainage (R v. L sided)
        - Rectal nodes → superficial inguinal → external iliac → common iliac
    - Haematogenous
        - Portal venous system → liver
        - Distal rectum → inferior rectal vein → IVC → lungs
        - Other → brain, bone, peritoneum
- How does pathologist determine which pathway a tumour followed (morphology, IHC?)
    - Morphology can give a clue (tubulovillous in APC, sessile serrated in MMR)
    - Cytogenetics
        - Mutated genes (e.g. APC, TP53, KRAS)
            - May be seen in APC pathway
    - Immunohistochemistry for microsatellite instability
        - MLH1, MSH2, MSH6
    - Note: immunohistochemistry can be used to determine the cell origin of certain cancers
        - In CRC, it is commonly CK20+, SATB2+ , CK7-
