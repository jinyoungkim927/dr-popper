# Appendicitis

## SPIEL

- I saw a cut-up of an appendix which was removed by laparascopic appendicectomy
    - Patient was a 24M who presented with a 4h history of peri-umbilical pain which localised to the RLQ, associated with nausea and vomiting
    - Indicated for anatomical pathology examination to exclude malignancy in rare cases
        - Carcinoma, mucinous tumours
- Macroscopic
    - Vermiform appendix was 80mm in length and 25mm in width
        - **There is significant mesoappendix attached which appears proliferative on the external surface**
    - Serosal surface
        - Dusky with heavily congested blood vessels
        - Fibrinosuppurative exudate appearing as dull and pale areas
        - No evidence of rupture
    - Specimen was sectioned longitudinally for internal examination
        - The appendiceal wall measures 4mm
            - Thickened and oedematous
        - Hyperaemic mucosa
        - There appeared to be some faecal material in the lumen
    - The tip of the appendix was sectioned for histological analysis to exclude tumours (carcinoid)
- Microscopic
    - Transmural inflammation with the hallmarks of acute inflammation
        - Vascular dilation and congestion
        - Oedema
        - Infiltration of inflammatory cells (neutrophils predominant)
    - Lymphoid hyperplasia (likely reactive)
    - No microscopic signs of carcinoid tumour in the tip
- Significance
    - Confirmed initial diagnosis
    - Confirmed that the appendicitis was not caused by a malignancy
    
- Pathogenesis
    - Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen (most common cause)
        - Lymphoid tissue hyperplasia (children, young adults)
        - Appendiceal faecolith and stasis (adults)
        - Neoplasm (uncommon)
        - Parasitic infection (uncommon)
    - Ongoing mucosal secretions = increased intraluminal pressure and distension
        - Impairment of venous and lymphatic outflow → swelling and oedema
    - Compression of appendiceal blood vessels → ischaemia and necrosis
        - Note: appendicular artery is an end-artery which is vulnerable to oedema or thrombosis from inflammation
    - Loss of epithelial integrity (inflammation) → bacterial translocation and suppurative inflammmation
    - Fibrino-exudative reaction on serosal surface → irritation of parietal peritoneum
- Complications
    - Acute and subacute
        - Gangrenous appendicitis
        - Rupture
            - Generalised peritonitis
            - Septic shock
            - Paralytic ileus
        - Abscess (appendiceal or periappendicular)
        - Phlegmon formation
            - Mass of inflamed appendix, adjacent bowel loops, omentum
    - Chronic
        - Adhesion formation (secondary to peritonitis or surgery)
            - Further risk of SBO
- Why is there fibrinous exudate? What does it look like microscopically
    - Occurs as a consequence of more severe injuries resulting in greater vascular permeability
        - Allows large molecules (e.g. fibrinogen) to pass the endothelial barrier
    - Characteristic of inflammation in the lining of body cavities
        - Can resolve (removal) or reorganise into scar tissue
    - Microscopic
        - Accumulated extravascular fibrin appears as an eosinophilic meshwork of threads or sometimes an amorphous coagulum

- Tumours of appendix
    - Carcinoid tumour
        - Slow-growing neuroendocrine tumour
            - Most common malignant tumour of the appendix (most frequently involves distal tip)
        - Histology
            - Nests of uniform cells that have regular round nuclei with “salt-and-pepper” chromatin
                - Absent or rare mitoses
                - Little pleomorphism

        - May cause carcinoid syndrome
            - Serotonin release (flushing, diarrhoea, oedema, cramping)
            - Bronchoconstriction (wheezing, cyanosis)
    - Conventional adenomas or non-mucin producing adenocarcinomas
        - May cause obstruction or enlargement which mimics acute appendicitis
