# Blood cultures

## SPIEL

- I saw a demonstration of how blood cultures were processed in the laboratory
    - Patient was a 65F with suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia
- Indications
    - Patients with fever, tachycardia or hypotension (suspected sepsis by SIRS criteria) with or without a suspected focus of infection
    - The threshold for investigation is lower in patients who are immunocompromised
- Collection
    - Two samples (3 in infective endocarditis) are collected via venepuncture from different sites over 2h
        - Minimum interval between samples is 10 mins
        - Reasoning:
            - 10 min interval to avoid detection of transient bacteraemia
            - ≥ 2 samples to avoid contaiminants
        - Ideally taken prior to antibiotic therapy
            - If not, take ASAP and from peripheral sites
    - 10mL of blood within each culture bottle
        - Fill aerobic bottle first (air in needle) before anaerobic needle
    - Bottle incubated for 5 days at 37 degrees (BacTec Blood Culture system)
        - System consists of incubator and agitator (promote mixing of sample periodically)
- Results
    - Preliminary results reported within 48h
        - Positive (colour change in disc at the bottom of the bottle due to CO2 production)
        - Negative → samples discarded after 5 days
    - For positive samples:
        - Gram stain (of sample from bottle) within 30 mins
            - Guides empirical therapy for clinician
        - Subculture is then grown on solid media
            - MALDI-TOF after 4h
                - Mass spectrometer which allows detection of the strain
            - Sensitivity testing
                - Basic nutrient agar is used and culture (suspended in water) is poured over
                    - Dried for even inoculation
                - Place disc of antibiotic on cultured organism and leave overnight
                - ‘Ring’ of growth inhibition around disc suggests sensitivity (organism unable to grow)
                    - Zone of inhibition is usually 6mm (same size as disc)
                    - Smaller for larger molecule antibiotics:
                        - e.g. gentamicin (4mm) and vancomycin (2mm)
            - May perform further microbiological testing to confirm species:
                - Haemolysis testing
                    - Sample grown on horse blood agar
                    - Alpha-haemolysis = partial or incomplete haemolysis
                        - Appears green on HBA
                        - S. pneumoniae or S. viridans
                    - Beta-haemolysis = complete haemolysis
                        - Yellow or transparent area around colonies
                            - Indicates the presence of haemolysin
                        - S. pyogenes
                        - S. aureus
                    - Non-haemolytic (gamma)
                        - S. epidermidis
                        - Enterococcus
                - Catalase test
                    - Catalase breaks down H2O2 into O2
                        - Detected as bubbles in agar
                    - Positive = staphylococcus, enterobacteriae
                    - Negative = streptococcus, enterococcus
                - Coagulase test
                    - S. aureus is coagulase positive
                        - Coagulase is an enzyme which leads to coagulation of blood in plasma
                    - Tested by two saline drops on two different slides (one test, one control)
                        - Add drop of rabbit plasma to test sample and see if the sample clumps
                        - Both clump suggests autoagglutination
                - Optochin sensitivity
    - In this case, Gram stain showed a Gram-positive streptococcus species (arranged in rows)
        - Catalase negative
        - Optochin sensitive
        - Alpha-haemolytic
    - Consistent with S. pneumoniae

- What is contained in an aerobic and anaerobic bottle?
    - Nutrient broth
        - Allows growth of organisms until there is enough to be cultured on agar
        - Includes water, nitrogen, growth factors, trace elements
    - Anti-coagulants
        - Neutralises natural bactericidal action of blood
    - Resin beads
        - Inhibits antibiotics if present
    - **Differences between aerobic and anaerobic bottles**
        - Aerobic bottles contain oxygen
        - Anaerobic tube has a reducing agent (glucose) and thioglycolate which consumes any oxygen in the sample
- What is MacConkey agar?
    - A selective medium designed to detect Gram negative bacteria (E. coli particularly)
        - Bile salts and crystal violet dye inhibit growth of Gram-positive bacteria
        - pH indicator and lactose can differentiate lactose fermenting colonies (turn agar pink) from non-lactose fermenting (colourless)
- What is MALDI-TOF
    - Indicated to identify atypical organisms
    - Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI)
        - Sample is mixed in large quantity of matrix
        - Matrix absorbs UV light and converts into heat energy which vaporises the sample
    - Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry
        - Charged ions are generated on the sample slide
            - Particles are accelerated through an electric field
        - Ions with a smaller mass and higher charge move through the drift space faster until they reach the detector
        - Hence, the time of ion flight differs according to the mass-to-charge ratio value of the ion
- Sources of error with blood cultures
    - Poor technique of collection
    - Insufficient disinfection of skin (commensal skin flora)
    - Antibiotic administration prior to culture collection can lead to negative results
