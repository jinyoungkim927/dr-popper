# Chronic cholecystitis

## SPIEL

- I saw a cut-up of a gallbladder which was removed by elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy
    - Patient was a 48F who presented with recurrent episodes of biliary colic characterised by RUQ pain worse after fatty meals
- Macroscopic
    - The specimen was received in formalin
        - Measured 80mm in length by 25mm in width
    - Serosal surface appeared smooth and shiny
        - No signs of inflammation or fibrinosuppurative exudate
        - **No evidence of fibrous adhesions, patchy ulcerations or porcelain gallbladder which may be expected with chronic inflammation**
    - Specimen received partially open - sectioned longitudinally
        - There were **numerous firm stones, yellow-brown in colour, within the lumen (≥ 10)**
            - **The largest stone measured 10mm in max diameter.**
        - Variable wall thickness, appeared rigid
            - Opaque grey-white appearance
        - Mucosal surface looks smooth and velvety
        - The cystic duct wall is thickened at around 4mm
- Microscopic
    - Representative sections of the gall bladder were taken from the cystic duct, neck and body
    - In absence of superimposed acute cholecystitis, mural lymphocytes are the only signs of inflammation
    - Evidence of simultaneous healing by repair
        - fibrosis, granulation tissue
    - Epithelial proliferation and **Rokitansky-Aschoff** sinuses
        - Outpouching of mucosa through the muscularis propria
    - Muscle layer thickening
- Significance
    - Confirmed diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis with associated cholelithiasis
        - Gallstones macroscopically consistent with cholesterol stones
    - No evidence of neoplasia
- Pathogenesis
    - Cholesterol stones
        - Three main contributing factors
            - Supersaturation of cholesterol which exceeds the solubilising capacity of bile
                - Cholesterol can no longer remain dispersed and crystallises out of solution
            - Gallbladder stasis
                - Promotes nucleation
            - Mucus hypersecretion
                - Results in trapping of crystals and enhances their aggregation into stones
        - Risk factors for gallstones
            - Factors related to increased cholesterol
                - Excessive hepatic cholesterol secretion → overloads capacity of bile salts and lecithin → precipitates cholesterol
                - 5 F’s
                    - Fat (BMI > 30)
                    - Fair (Caucasian)
                    - Female
                    - Forty (increased age)
                    - Fertile (oestrogen, multiparous, pregnant)
                - **Also diabetes and rapid weight loss**
            - Factors related to decreased bile salts
                - Crohn’s (more specific for pigment stones) → likely due to altered enterohepatic cycling
                - Genetics (FHx)
            - Factors related to gallbladder stasis
                - Prolonged fasting or TPN
                - Spinal cord injury
                - Certain medications (e.g. somatostatin analogues)
    - Acute calculous cholecystitis + pain
        - Obstruction at the neck of the gallbladder or other part of the biliary tree by a gallstone
            - Chemical irritation and inflammation of the gallbladder walls secondary to obstruction of bile outflow
                - Release of phospholipases derived from mucosa
                    - Lecithin is hydrolysed to lysolecithin
                        - Disrupts protective mucous layer and exposes epithelium to detergent action of bile salts
                            - Emulsification of fats within cell membrane
                    - Prostaglandin production result in further inflammation
            - Distension and mucous hypersecretion → increased intraluminal pressure  and distension
                - May compromise blood flow to the mucosa → ischaemia
                    - Impaired epithelial integrity can result in superimposed bacterial infection
        - Irritation of visceral peritoneum → pain afferents travel to T5-T9 levels (interscapular pain, R chest, back)
            - Irritation of parietal peritoneum associated with the diaphragm → referred shoulder pain along C3-C5 of phrenic nerve
- Complications
    - Acute
        - Gangrenous cholecystitis
            - Bacterial superinfection from bile stasis
            - **Risk of perforation resulting in:**
                - **Pericholecystic abscess**
                - **Peritonitis**
                - **Sepsis**
        - Gallstone pancreatitis
            - Obstruction at hepatopancreaticoduodenal ampulla (of Vater)
        - Cholecystoenteric fistula
            - Gallstone ileus
                - Rare cause of mechanical SBO due to perforation of gallbladder into intestinal lumen and obstruction of terminal ileum
                - Rigler’s triad (SBO, stone in ileum, **pneumobilia**)
        - Mirizzi's syndrome (rare)
            - Obstructive jaundice due to extrinsic compression of common hepatic duct due to gallstones in neck OR cystic duct
        - **Ascending cholangitis**
            - Choledocholithiasis → biliary stasis + bacterial superinfection of biliary tree
            - Can lead to sepsis
    - Chronic
        - Chronic cholecystitis
            - Scarring and fibrosis
            - Luminal narrowing → increased susceptibility of obstruction
                - Can result in porcelain gallbladder (calcium salts precipitate in fluid or walls)
        - Carcinoma of gallbladder
            - Rare, but increased risk in chronic cholecystitis
        - Chronic pancreatitis
        - Secondary biliary cirrhosis

- Why would the gallbladder need to be sent to anatomical pathology
    - Confirm pathological changes macroscopically and microscopically
    - Rule out malignancy, complications
- What is the likely composition of the gallstones
    - 80% cholesterol
        - Large, pale-yellow
            - Multiple and multifaceted (due to apposition)
            - Ovoid and firm
        - Mostly radiolucent but 20% can be radio-opaque due to calcification (CaCO3 or CaPO4)
            - Often contain some bilirubin or CaCO3 (look more grey/black)
    - 20% pigment
        - Black
            - **Radio-opaque, numerous, small in size, crumble easily**
                - Formed due to calcium precipitating with bilirubin (calcium bilirubinate)
            - Causes
                - Haemolysis (thalassemia, sickle cell anaemia, spherocytosis)
                - Cirrhosis
                - Gilbert's syndrome
        - Brown
            - **Single or few in number**
                - Associated with bacteria
            - **Soft, greasy consistency** due to the retention of fatty acid salts released by bacterial phospholipases on biliary lecithins
            - **Radiolucent**
        
- How do the gallstones lead to recurrent biliary colic?
    - Biliary colic is recurrent episodes of RUQ or epigastric pain often lasting 30mins, related to food consumption, and may be associated with nausea and vomiting
    - Caused by contraction of the gallbladder which results in a stone (or sludge) to be forced against the gallbladder outlet **(Hartmann’s pouch or cystic duct)**
        - Increasing intra-gallbladder pressure leads to pain
        - Pain resolves as gallbladder relaxes and the stone dislodges from the outlet
        
- Changes in acute cholecystitis
    - Macroscopic
        - Enlarged gallbladder (2-3x normal size)
        - Contains stones and cloudy, turbid bile with fibrin and pus
        - Fibrinous exudate on serosal surface
        - Thickened wall with oedema, hyperaemia and possible evidence of ischaemia
        - Focal areas of ulceration and necrosis
            - May be perforated
        - Discoloured mucosa from haemorrhage
    - Microscopic
        - Thickening of wall with oedema and hyperaemia
        - Inflammation, leukocyte infiltration (neutrophils, macrophages), vascular congestion
        - Thickening of muscle layer secondary to obstruction
        - May have necrosis with perforation
- Signs on examination in acute cholecystitis
    - Murphy’s sign
        - Place hand in deep palpation under the costal margin, level of 9th costal cartilage
        - Ask patient to inspire
        - Results in pain/cessation of inspiration as inflamed gallbladder contacts examiner’s hand and irritates peritoneum
    - Charcot’s triad
        - **Fever**
        - **Jaundice**
        - **RUQ pain**
    - Reynaud’s pentad (cholangiitis)
        - Triad + hypotension + altered mental status
- Gallbladder cancer and types?
    - Carcinoma of the gallbladder
        - Gallstones present in 60-90% of cases
        - Most commonly adenocarcinoma which can be papillary or poorly differentiated
            - Rarely SCC or neuroendocrine tumours
    - Cholangiocarcinoma (from cells lining the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts)
