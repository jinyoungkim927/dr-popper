# ESR

## SPIEL

- I saw a demonstration of how an erythrocyte sedimentation rate test is performed in the laboratory
    - This was done for a 64 M with back pain and AKI, suspicious of multiple myeloma
- Indications
    - Non-specific marker of inflammation
        - Used to aid the diagnosis of:
            - Giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and systemic vasculitis
                - Significant ESR elevation supports diagnosis
        - Useful for prognosis and monitoring disease progress
            - RA, myeloma
    - Largely superseded by CRP which is a more sensitive early indicator of an acute phase response in inflammation
        - CRP is a direct measure of inflammatory markers (synthesised by the liver and thus time sensitive process) whereas ESR is indirect
- Physiological principles behind the ESR
    - ESR is the rate at which erythrocytes suspended in plasma settle in a vertical tube
        - Normally RBCs do not sediment due to their negative charge (zeta potential)
    - Inflammation results in IL-6 production which promotes hepatic synthesis of fibrinogen (positive charge)
        - Negates the zeta potential on RBCs and results in stacking of RBCs (Rouleaux) and increased sedimentation
    - Many plasma proteins have a positive charge which negates this negative zeta potentatial
        - Hence, may also be seen in monoclonal gammopathies (antibodies)
- Collection
    - 4mL blood sample was collected via venepuncture in an EDTA tube (or citrate tube)
        - **Contains a chelator to remove calcium and prevent clotting**
        - **Must be filled to the line so that there is a correct ratio of anticoagulant to blood**
        - Tube is labelled and transported to a pathology lab
    - Blood is well mixed and placed in a 20cm long Westergren sedimentation tube (2.5cm internal bore)
        - Specialised rack with gradations
        - Over time, the RBCs sediment to the bottom of the tube
    - After 1h
        - the height of the column of clear plasma above the sedimenting RBCs is measured (in mm)
        - Reported as the ESR in mm/hr
- Interpreting results
    - Normal
        - < 15mm/hr for males
        - < 20 mm/hr for females
    - Elevation suggests
        - Infection, inflammation
        - Malignancy
        - Pregnancy
        - Anaemia
    - May be reduced in:
        - **Polycythaemia (reduces blood viscosity and the rate at which rouleaux stacks settle)**
        - Abnormal RBCs (sickle cell, hereditary spherocytosis)
- Sources of error
    - False elevation
        - High temperature (decreases blood viscosity)
        - Sedimentation tube may be tilted
    - False reduction
        - Shorter sedimentation tubes
        - Low temperatures
        - Delay in testing after venepuncture
            - Causes RBC sphering and falsely decreases ESR
            - Test should be run within 2h of collection
    - Other
        - Incorrect proportion of anticoagulant
            - Clotted sample would inhibit rouleaux formation and decrease ESR
        - Haemolysed sample
            - Causes Hb to leak into plasma, turning it red
            - Makes it difficult to differentiate from the sedimented RBCs
        - Failure to read at one hour

- How does Rouleaux formation occur
    - Stacking of RBCs which is possible due to their discoid shape (flat surfaces allow them to make contact with one another and stick together)
        - Hence, abnormal RBCs reduce ESR
