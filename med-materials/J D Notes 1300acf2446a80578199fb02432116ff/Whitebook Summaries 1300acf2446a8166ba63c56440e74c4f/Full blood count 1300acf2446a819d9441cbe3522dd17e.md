# Full blood count

## SPIEL

- I observed an automated analysis of a full blood count
    - FBC is a series of tests which is used to evaluate the composition and concentration of the cellular components of blood (RBC, WBC, platelets)
    - This did not pertain to a particular patient but common indications included:
        - Pre-operative test to ensure both adequate oxygen carrying capacity and haemostasis
        - Identify persons who may have an infection
        - Diagnose anaemia
        - Identify acute and chronic illness, bleeding tendencies, WBC disorders (e.g. leukaemia)
        - Determine the effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy on bone marrow production
- Collection
    - Venous blood sample collected in an EDTA tube using aseptic technique
    - **EDTA chelates calcium and prevents coagulation**
- Process
    - Specimen is barcoded and placed into the automated analyser
        - A small sample of blood is aspirated into a chamber and diluted with balanced isotonic saline solution
    - Diluted sample is split into 3 different chambers:
        - Erythrocytes and platelets
            - Platelets often counted by electrical impedence or manual haemocytometer
        - Haemoglobin
            - Reagant lyses the red cells to measure the Hb released
        - Leukocytes
            - Require a sample diluted in buffers which lyse RBCs and thus leave behind the WBCs
            - Often differentiated by flow cytometry whereby:
                - Cells in suspension are passed, single file, through an optical flow cell where each interacts with a laser beam
                - Light is deflected differentially depending on cell size and complexity, or granularity
                - These signals can be plotted on a scattergram
                    - Cell types are then assigned based on the expected profile.
            - Automated analysers are poor at identifying or typing abnormal or immature cells
                - Unclassifiable cells will be flagged by **manual review of a blood film**
            - Automated analysers may also erroneously count nucleated erythroblasts or stacked RBCs (due to increased antibodies) as WBCs due to their increase in size
    - Small amount of each fluid is passed through an aperture where current is applied by two electrodes
        - The cells act as resistors and increase the impedance according to size
        - Hence, a pulse is created whereby its amplitude is proportional to size (Coulter Principle)
    - Different cells produce different impedances and the machine will group them according to thresholds (e.g. RBC > 36fL and platelets = 2-20fL)
        - Red cell data is formed into a bell curve
            - AUC = RCC
            - Width = RDW
            - Mean = MCV
        - Quantitative measurements from an automated FBC
            - Haemoglobin
            - Haematocrit
            - RBC count
        - Qualitative measurements calculated from these results
            - MCV
            - MCH and MCHC
            - RDW
    - Process is repeated three times
        - If agreement is found between the results, then they are accepted and a result is calculated
        - Significant abnormalities (low numbers) will flag the need for a manual count or differential
- Sources of error
    - RBCs and WBCs can be counted together (WBC normally have minimal contribution)
        - Can lead to inaccurate RBC counts when a large number of WBCs are present
    - RBC count can be decreased if RBCs are lysed as part of, or following, the collection process
        - Clotting of sample can also lead to inaccurately low RBC counts
    - MCV, MCH and MCHC are average calculations
        - If RBCs have significantly different size of Hb content, these parameters may not reflect the mixed population
        - Manual review is essential
    - Haematocrit can be erroneously increased by the presence of giant platelets which can be falsely counted as RBCs

- What does EDTA stand for
    - Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
