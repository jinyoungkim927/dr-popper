# ANA (indirect immunofluorescence)

## SPIEL

- I saw a demonstration of how anti-nuclear antibody testing via indirect immunofluorescence is performed
    - Used in the context of aiding the diagnosis of SLE in a 34F presenting with malar rash, fatigue, fever and polyarthritis
- Indication
    - Screening test for multisystem autoimmune diseases such as SLE, scleroderma, Sjogrenâ€™s
- Collection
    - Venous blood sample collected in a serum separator tube (allows separation of the ANA within the serum from whole blood)
- Pathophysiology of ANA
    - It is thought that antibodies to nuclear antigens (e.g. anti double-stranded DNA) result from a dysregulated immune response to self-antigens
        - **Underlying failure of apoptosis and appropriate removal of cellular material** which results in proteins which normally are hidden within the cell to be detectable by the immune system
- Process
    - **With the immunofluorescence method, ANA levels are reported as a dilutional titre where screening is done to a 1:80 level as per ACR/EULAR classification guidelines**
        - Sample is run with serial dilutions (starting at 1:80) of patient serum until less than 50% of sample shows fluorescent pattern
    - Serum is diluted, added to a microslide containing Hep2 lineage cells and incubated
        - These cells are chosen due to their large nuclei which allows easy visualisation of bound antigens
    - If ANAs are present, they will bind to nuclear antigens. The slide is washed to remove any unbound antigens
    - Anti-human IgG with a fluorescent tag is added which attaches to any bound antigen-antibody complexes
        - These antibodies fluoresce when exposed to a certain wavelength of light
        - Pattern is visualised under a microscope
- Results
    - This women had a homogenous pattern of speckling which supports a diagnosis of SLE
        - However, may also be seen in drug-induced lupus, MCTD
    - Needs to be followed up with:
        - Anti-dsDNA and anti-histone Ab
        - ENA panel
            - Anti-Smith
            - Anti-U1 RNP
            - Anti-Ro, Anti-La
- Limitations
    - What does HEp-2 stand for? Limitations of using this cell lineage
        - Human epithelial laryngeal carcinoma type 2 cells
        - Subjective on multiple factors:
            - Laboratory manufacturing the substrate cells
            - Skill of the individual reading the result
            - Definition of a positive result in each laboratory
    - Moderate intensity ANA is present in 5-15% of healthy normal population
        - **Clinical pre-test probability is important for interpretation**
    - Highly sensitive for some rheumatic diseases (e.g. SLE, sclerodera)
        - Low NPV for many (e.g. RA, seronegative spondyloarthropathies, vasculitides)

- How would this be performed in ELISA
    - ELISA is commonly a confirmatory test
        - Allows quantitative screening for specific ANAs and has proven to perform comparatively to immunofluorescence
    - Patient serum is incubated in wells coated with cell nuclei antigens which allows any patient antibodies in the serum to bind to antigens
        - Secondary antibody with a conjugated enzyme tag is added which binds to the patient serum antibodies
        - Sample washed to remove any unbound antibodies
    - Substrate to the enzyme is added which triggers a chemical reaction (often a colour change) that can be detected by spectrophotometry
