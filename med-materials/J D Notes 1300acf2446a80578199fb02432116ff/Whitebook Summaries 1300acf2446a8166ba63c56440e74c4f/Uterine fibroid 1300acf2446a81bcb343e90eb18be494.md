# Uterine fibroid

## SPIEL

- I saw a cut up of a uterine fibroid from a 37 F who had an elective myomectomy. The remainder of the clinical history is unknown as they were a private patient
    - Indication for pathology is to **exclude malignant change of the leiomyoma into a leiomyosarcoma**
- Macroscopic
    - 7 fibroids were received in formalin
        - Largest fibroid measured 150mm max diameter by 90mm by 50mm
        - It was firm and grey-white in appearance
    - External surface is smooth and irregular
        - Numerous large nodules and masses
        - There are some small areas of haemorrhage
    - The fibroid was sectioned
        - **Cut surface was smooth and homogenous with a whorled appearance**
        - No signs of necrosis
- Microscopic
    - **Bundles of smooth muscle cells which mimic the appearance of normal myometrium**
    - May see foci of fibrosis, calcification and degenerative softening
    - **Often surrounded by a pseudocapsule of compressed areolar tissue and smooth muscle cells**
        - Contains few blood vessels and lymphatic vessels
        - **Distinguishes fibroids from adenomyosis which tends to be more diffusely organised in the myometrium**

- What is leiomyoma? Epidemiology? Risk factors?
    - Benign proliferations of smooth muscle cells of the myometrium
        - Typically occur in women of childbearing age and then regress during menopause
    - Epidemiology
        - Most common benign gynaecological tumour in pre menopausal women
        - Incidence of clinical symptoms is higher in African ethnicity
    - Risk factors
        - Associated with hyperoestrogenic states
            - Early menarche
            - Use of OCP before age 16
            - Increase in BMI
        - Protective factors
            - Progestin only contraceptives
            - Multiparity
- Leiomyomas - clinical symptoms
    - Many are asymptomatic and require no treatment
    - FIBROIDS
        - Frequency and retention of urine (hydronephrosis)
        - **Iron deficiency anaemia (secondary to bleeding)**
        - Bleeding abnormalities (heavy menstrual bleeding, postcoital spotting)=
        - **Reproductive difficulties (dysfunctional labor, premature labour)**
        - Obstipation and rectal pressure
        - **Infertility**
        - Dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia
        - **Symptomless (most common)**
    - Pelvic pain is often not part of the symptom complex unless vascular compromise is present
- Classification of uterine fibroids
    - By location
        - Submucosal (beneath endometrium)
            - Often associated with heavy or prolonged bleeding
        - Intramural (in muscular wall of uterus)
            - Most common type
        - Subserosal (beneath uterine serosa)
    - A parasitic leiomyoma is a pedunculated fibroid which becomes attached to the pelvic viscera or omentum and develops its own blood supply

- Pathophysiology of leiomyoma
    - Comprised of monoclonal cells arising from the myometrium
        - Genetic predisposition, steroid hormone factors, growth factors and angiogenesis may all play a role
    - Leiomyomas have an increased expression of both oestrogen and progesterone receptors when compared to normal myometrium
        - Complex hormonal response
            - Growth may be stimulated by ovarian steroids, oestrodiol and progesterone
            - Size of fibroids often decline after menopause when hormone levels fall
    - Some leiomyomas can enlarge to outgrow their blood supply resulting in infarction and degeneration → pain
    - **Rare to develop into leiomyosarcoma (thought to be separate neoplastic entities)**
- Diagnosis of leiomyoma
    - Comprehensive history and physical examination
        - May be palpated on bimanual pelvic examination or abdominal examination
        - Non-tender irregularly enlarged uterus with cobblestone protrusions
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - Pelvic ultrasound
            - Fibroids = areas of hypoechogenicity among normal myometrial material
        - Pelvic MRI
            - Can help determine the extent of vascularisation or degeneration of leiomyomas
            - Better defines the relationship to serosal and mucosal surfaces
            - Helps distinguish from adenomyosis
        - Hysterosalpingogram and hysteroscopy
            - Can help distinguish fibroids from polyps
            - Can aid imaging of the location and size of uterine fibroids
- Management of leiomyoma
    - Expectant management is appropriate for most cases which are asymptomatic and unequivocal (exclusion of other causes of pelvic mass)
        - Monitor every 6 months if actively growing fibroids
    - Non-hormonal options (NSAIDs, TXA)
        - Treat dysmenorrhoea, anaemia, heavy menstrual bleeding
    - Hormonal options
        - COCP
        - Progestins (mini-pill, Mirena IUD)
        - GnRH agonists (goserelin, leuprolide)
            - Found to shrink fibroids and decrease bleeding by decreasing circulating oestrogen
    - Surgical
        - Myomectomy (surgical resection of ≥ 1 fibroid from the uterine wall)
            - High chance of fibroid recurrence in 5 years
        - Hysterectomy (definitive)
- What would you expect to see in leiomyosarcoma
    - Often solitary lesions which most often occur in post-menopausal women
    - Macroscopic
        - Soft, haemorrhage, necrotic masses
    - Microscopic
        - Evidence of tumour necrosis
        - Evidence of neoplasia
            - Cytological atypia
            - Increased mitotic activity
        - May resemble well-differentiated leiomyoma or look widely anaplastic
