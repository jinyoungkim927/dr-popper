# Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

*A 23-year-old female presented to her GP with a 4-week history of dry cough following an URTI. On examination, several non-tender enlarged lymph nodes (1.5-2.0cm diameter) were found on the right side of the neck. There was no visible evidence of pharyngitis. FBC and blood film were normal.* CXR detected mediastinal mass.

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: given patient age and history of persistent cervical lymphadenopathy, Hodgkin’s lymphoma
        - Mediastinal mass likely represents lymphadenopathy
    - DDx for generalised lymphadenopathy
        - Malignancy
        - Infectious
        - Autoimmune
        - Miscellaneous
            - Sarcoidosis
        - Iatrogenic
- Investigative approach to lymphoma
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - Excisional lymph node biopsy
            - Allows determination of type of lymphoma (e.g. immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, microscopy)
            - Excisional > core needle > FNA
                - FNA provides cytology with no architecture
                    - More false negatives
        - Peripheral blood smear
            - Nucleated RBCs and circulating blasts (if bone marrow involved)
            - Atypical lymphocytes in EBV infection
            - Blasts in leukaemia
        - Bone marrow aspirate and trephine
    - Ancillary
        - Bedside
            - ECG - pre-treatment baseline
        - Labs
            - FBC
                - Anaemia - chronic disease or bone marrow failure
                - Leucocytosis in infection
            - EUC - baseline, derangement in cell lysis
            - LFT - baseline
            - CRP/ESR - raised in inflammation
            - LDH - indicates high cell turnover, prognostic indicator
            - Autoimmune causes
                - ANA for screening - follow up with ENA
            - Microbiological causes
                - Nasopharyngeal swab for MCS, PCR - EBV, CMV
                - Serology for EBV, CMV, HIV
                - Monospot test for EBV
        - Imaging
            - CXR - rule out mediastinal mass
            - CT CAP / FDG-PET - staging
- Interpret FBC

    - Normocytic normochromic anaemia
        - Anaemia of chronic disease
        - Bone marrow failure due to infiltration of the bone marrow by malignant cells
        - Haemolysis
    - Raised ESR
        - Reflects release of inflammatory cytokines (esp. IL-6) by RS cells in Hodgkin’s
    - Note: lymphocytosis does not occur unlike leukaemia as it is a cancer of lymph nodes
- Microscopic features of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
    - Reed-Sternberg cells
        - Enlarged B cells with multilobed nuclei and prominent nucleoli **(”owl-eye”)**
        - Classically CD15+ and CD30+
        - **DO NOT EXPRESS CD45 (all other lymphocytes do)**
    - Reactive inflammatory cells
        - Lymphocytes, plasma cells
        - Macrophages
        - Eosinophils

- What are the subtypes of Hodgkin’s lymphoma
    - Hodgkin’s lymphoma is neoplastic proliferation of Reed-Sternberg cells
        - RS cells secrete cytokines and hence:
            - B symptoms are more prominent (fever, weight loss, night sweats)
            - Attract reactive lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, eosinophils
            - May lead to fibrosis
        - Reactive inflammatory cells make up the bulk of the tumour (basis of classification)
    - Subtypes
        - Classic HL (90%)
            - Nodular sclerosing [70%]
                - Nodular morphology due to dividing bands of sclerosis
                - RS cells present in lacunae
                - Classically supradiaphragmatic in young people (mediastinal, cervical)
            - Mixed cellularity
                - Associated with HIV
                - Eosinophils (due to IL5) and RS cells
            - Lymphocyte rich
                - Excellent prognosis
            - Lymphocyte depleted
                - Most aggressive + seen in elderly
                - Associated with HIV
                - Express EBV proteins
        - Nodular lymphocyte predominant (10%)
            - Popcorn cells (RS variants with multilobulated puffy nuclei)
                - CD15- and CD30-
- Compare Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
    - Lymphoma is a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells which form a mass
        - May arise in lymph nodes or extranodal tissue
    
    |  | Hodgkin | NHL |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Prevalence | Bimodal age (late adolescence, older adulthood). Less common | Risk increases with age > 50. More common |
    | Malignant cells | Reed-Sternberg cells | Lymphoid cells |
    | Composition of mass | Predominantly reactive cells (inflammatory and fibrosis) | Lymphoid cells |
    | Clinical | Painless lymphadenopathy occasionally with ‘B’ symptoms. Often in young adults | Painless lymphadenopathy. Often in late adulthood |
    | Spread | **Contiguous**, rarely extranodal (often supradiaphragmatic) | **Diffuse (non-contiguous), often extranodal** |
    | Staging | Guides therapy. Radiation is mainstay of treatment | Limited importance |
    | Leukaemic phase | Does not occur | Occurs |

- How is Hodgkin’s lymphoma staged? What does stage IIA mean?
    - Ann Arbor staging + Cotswald system (modifier) = Lugano classification
    - Stage IIA
        - Involvement of ≥ 2 LN regions on the same side of the diaphragm with no B symptoms

- Why is it more important to stage Hodgkin’s compared to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma? Prognostic indices for both?
    
    Hodgkin’s lymphoma tends to have contiguous and subsequently more predictable spread
    
    - As a consequence, staging has improved prognostic value
    - By comparison, NHL usually presents with disseminated disease.
    
    Both Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma have different prognostic indexes 
    
    - Hodgkin’s: **Hasenclever International Prognostic Score**
    - non-Hodgkin’s: International prognostic index
- How do you treat Hodgkin’s lymphoma
    - Individualised based on patient factors and disease factors (Lugano classification)
    - General principles
        - Stage 1-2
            - Combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy
            - ABVD
                - Adriamycin
                - Bleomycin
                - Vinblastine
                - Dacarbazine
        - Stage 2-4
            - Combination chemotherapy
                - ABVD or other
    - Consider treatment related toxicity as most patients will achieve remission
- Prognosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma v. NHL
    - Hodgkin’s
        - Average 5 year survival = 87%
            - If age 15-39, average 5 year survival = 95%
        - Best prognosis in lymphocyte rich HL
        - Worst in lymphocyte depleted HL (as treatment mainly targets lymphocytes)
    - NHL
        - Much poorer prognosis but depends upon subtype and age
            - Mantle cell
                - 25% 5 year survival
            - Burkitt lymphoma
                - 55% 5 year survival
            - DLBCL
                - 50%

- Utility of bone marrow biopsy in NHL and HL
    - HL
        - Excisional biopsy preferred OR multiple core needle biopsies of a lymph node
            - FNAB does not provide sufficient tissue and cannot make a definitive histological classification
        - **BM biopsy largely superceded as PET-CT is sensitive to detect BM involvement**
    - NHL
        - Lymph node biopsy preferred
        - If no overt lymphadenopahy, may require other tissue (e.g. bone marrow)
        - **BM biopsy largely superceded as PET-CT is sensitive to detect BM involvement**
