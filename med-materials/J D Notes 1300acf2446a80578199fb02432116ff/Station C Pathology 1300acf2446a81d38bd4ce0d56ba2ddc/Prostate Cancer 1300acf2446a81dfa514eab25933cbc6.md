# Prostate Cancer

## Case Protocol 14 – **Prostate Cancer**

*A 65-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with a six-hour history of interscapular pain, urinary retention and mild bilateral leg weakness. On further questioning, he revealed that he had felt unwell for six weeks and had lost 3 kg in the past month.*

*On examination he had a distended bladder, signs of corticospinal dysfunction in both legs, decreased sensation to the level of his rib cage and reduction in vibration sense below his iliac crest.*

- Provisional Dx and causes
    - Given the acute urinary retention, bone pain and bilateral lower limb neurological symptoms, PDx is spinal cord compression
        - With the recent malaise and weight loss, this raises the suspicion for malignancy
    - Causes
        - Epidural extension of vertebral body metastases
            - Common sources: prostate, breast, lung, colon, renal cell
        - Carcinomatosis meningitis (spread of cancer to meninges)
        - Pathological vertebral fracture (secondary to neoplasia (e.g. myeloma))
- Explain the pathophysiology of the above presentation
    - Local compression from prostate tumour
        - Obstruction of outflow → urinary retention → distended bladder
    - Metastatic spinal cord compression
        - Loss of autonomic function → urinary retention
        - Compression of dorsal column → reduction in vibration and sensation in LL
        - Compression of corticospinal tract → bilateral leg weakness and hyporeflexia
        - Compression of nerves or bony tenderness → interscapular pain
    - Neoplastic constitutional symptoms → weight loss, fever, malaise
- Differentials for spinal cord compression
    - Neoplastic
        - Primary bone cancer (benign - osteoblastoma; malignant - osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma)
        - Secondary (prostate, breast, kidney, thyroid, lung)
        - wld u investigate a cns lesion >> for his symptoms and drop mets?
    - Mechanical
        - Vertebral fractures (e.g. osteoporosis, osteomalacia, hyperPTH)
        - Intervertebral disc herniation

    - Elevated urea and creatinine (AKI) → likely a post-renal cause due to outflow obstruction (invasion of base of bladder)
        - Bladder distension and hydronephrosis
    - Hyponatraemia (may be dilutional due to water retention)
    - Hyperkalaemia (failure of excretion)
- Grading of prostate cancer
    - Gleason grading system - based on the architectural features of the sample
        - Grade 1 (best differentiation) → higher score = more aggressive, worse prognosis
    - Composite Gleason score
        - Formed by adding together the Gleason grades of the two most prevalent differentiation patterns
            - Initially scored from 1-5 based on the extent of tissue differentiation
            - Regraded based on the primary pattern + highest pattern then grouped
                - Grade ≥ 6 is cancer
                    - Group 1 (good) [Grade 1: 3+3 = 6]
                    - Group 2 (intermediate) [Grade 2: 3+4, 4+3 = 7]
                    - Group 3-5 (poor) [8-10]

- Screening for prostate cancer
    - What is PSA test?
        - A blood test which measures PSA (an enzyme produced by the prostate)
            - PSA breaks down fibrinogen in semen which has clotted at the cervix to allow it to navigate freely through to the uterus or fallopian tubes
            - The absence of basal cells in prostate cancer increases the propensity for PSA to leak into the circulation than the duct lumen
        - Serum PSA levels reflect the amount of glandular epithelium (and prostate size)
            - Male prostates tend to increase in size with age as they become more sensitive to androgens
            - PSA > 10ng/mL is very concerning for cancer
    - Issues with screening
        - Low specificity - high rate of false positives
            - PSA increased in prostate injury, prostatitis, hyperplasia, UTI
            - Risk of overdiagnosis (unnecessary stress, invasive testing, costs to healthcare system)
        - Adverse effects from treatment of non-specific prostate cancer
            - Erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence
            - Benefit to overall survival is minimal
    - Population screening is not recommended - need to discuss risks with patient

    - Consider in high-risk situations (1st degree relative, BRCA2)
    - Relevant if patient is symptomatic
    - Relevant if patient has known cancer
        - Identify baseline levels at diagnosis (prognostic)
        - Monitor response to treatment
- Pain management in cancer (WHO ladder)

    - Arterial supply
        - Prostate (second) branch of inferior vesical artery (from internal iliac artery)
        - Contributions from:
            - Middle rectal artery
            - Internal pudendal artery
    - Venous drainage
        - Drains into a prostatic venous plexus between the true and false capsules → vesicoprostatic plexus → internal iliac veins
        - Communicates with internal iliac vein → lateral sacral plexus (Batson’s plexus) → internal vertebral plexus
            - Potential to metastasise to spine, brain, lungs
    - Innervation
        - Supplied from the left and right inferior hypogastric plexuses

        - Local spread
            - Most commonly into seminal vesicles → perineural spread via shared nerve plexus
            - Bladder
            - Rectum (uncommon due to rectoprostatic fascia)
        - Haematogenous
            - Spinal metastases
                - Via prostatic venous plexus → vesicoprostatic plexus → internal iliac veins → lateral sacral veins (Batson’s) → internal vertebral venous plexus
                - Via azygos → SVC → internal vertebral venous plexus
            - Brain metastases
                - Internal vertebral venous plexus → dural venous sinus
            - Lung
            - Liver
        - Lymphatic spread
- Anatomy of vertebral venous plexuses
    - Vertebral venous plexuses are a network of veins located within and around the length of the vertebral column
        - Internal vertebral venous plexus → network within the vertebral canal
        - External vertebral venous plexus → network outside the vertebral canal
            - Intramuscular and divided into anterior and posterior parts
    - Plexuses are largely valveless and freely connected with one another as well as other veins:
        - Basivertebral veins (paired): drain the marrow of vertebral bodies
        - Segmental veins (vertebral, posterior, intercostal, lumbar, lateral sacral): drain viscera (including pelvis)
        - Dural venous sinuses (cranium)
    - Function
        - Provides a collateral venous pathway in the event of occlusion of the vena cava
        - Pathway for haematogenous spread of prostate, breast, renal, thyroid, lung, uterine cancer
- Ductus deferens and seminal vesicles anatomy
    - Ductus deferens
        - Long muscular duct which transports spermatozoa from the tail of the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct
        - Course
            - Ascends in the spermatic cord
                - Passes through the inguinal canal and deep inguinal ring
                    - Bends medially around the lateral side of the inferior epigastric artery
            - Crosses the external iliac artery and vein at the pelvic inlet to enter the pelvic cavity
            - Duct descends medially on the pelvic wall, deep to the peritoneum
                - Crosses the ureter posterior to the bladder
                - Continues inferomedially along the base of the bladder, anterior to the rectum (almost to the midline)
                    - Joined by the duct of the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct
            - Ductus deferens expands to form the ampulla of the ductus deferens between the ureter and ejaculatory duct
                - Duct penetrates through the prostate to connect with the prostatic urethra
    - Seminal vesicle
        - Develops as a blind ended tubular outgrowth of the ductus deferens
        - Coiled tube with numerous pocket-like outgrowths which is encapsulated by connective tissue to form an elongate structure between the bladder and rectum
            - Gland is immediately lateral to and follows the course of the ductus deferens at the base of the bladder
        - Duct of the seminal vesicle joins the ductus deferens to form the ejaculatory duct
            - Secretions from the seminal vesicle contribute significantly to the volume of ejaculate (semen)

### Memorandum: Prostate Cancer (pathology)

*An 80-year-old man presents with a 6-week history of lower back pain that wakes him up at night. He’s lost 6kg over the past 2 months. Vitals stable, no proteinuria, haematuria. On examination, revealed spinal and pelvic bony tenderness. No other neurological abnormalities.*

- Approach to history
    - HOPC
        - Characterise the back pain (SOCRATES)
            - Red flag symptoms
                - Cancer
                    - Progressively worsening pain, present at rest or night time, constitutional symptoms
                    - Conduct a systems review and ask about cancer screening
                - Fracture
                    - Osteoporosis, trauma Hx, prolonged steroid use, causes of secondary osteoporosis or bone disease
                - Infection
                    - Fever, immunocompromised, IVDU
                - Cauda equina
                    - Urinary incontinence or retention, faecal incontinence or retention, bilateral LL neurological deficits
        - Symptoms of prostate cancer
            - Local: voiding difficulty
            - Systemic: constitutional changes
    - PMHx - underlying medical conditions, previous Hx of cancer, medications, allergies
    - FHx - of cancer
    - SHx
        - Smoking, drugs, alcohol
        - Yellow flags for back pain (psychosocial factors)
            - Belief or attitudes towards the pain
            - Avoidance behaviours (e.g. reduced activity levels)
            - Tendency for low mood or social withdrawal
            - Lack of social support
            - Financial problems
- Approach to examination
    - Full neurological and spine MSK exam
        - Bony tenderness
        - Signs of spinal cord compression
    - Regional lymph node exam
    - Abdominal examination
    - DRE and assessment of anal tone
        - Cancer: focal firm area within prostate - irregular, hard mass
        - BPH: smooth homogenous enlargement with loss of median raphe
- Describe X-ray

    - An AP pelvic X-ray demonstrating widespread sclerotic lesions in the lumbar vertebra, pelvis and bilateral femurs
        - Most likely due to the presence of bony metastases (osteoblast overactivity in response to prostate adenocarcinoma)
        - Loss of uniform opacity
- DDx of lytic and sclerotic lesions on X-ray
    - Lytic
        - Primary bone cancer (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma)
        - Multiple myeloma
        - Bone abscess
        - Metastases (GIT, thyroid, renal, most lung, SCC)
    - Sclerotic
        - Prostate cancer
        - Most breast cancer
        - Lymphoma
    - Note: some cancers may be mixed lytic/sclerotic
    - Other causes
        - Vascular: infarct, haemangiomas
        - Infection: subacute/chronic osteomyelitis
        - Trauma: vertebral or pelvic stress fracture
        - Metabolic: Paget’s disease (mixed lytic sclerotic)
        - Congenital: osteopoikilosis
            - Benign, AD, sclerosing dysplasia of bone characterised by the presence of numerous bone islands in the skeleton
