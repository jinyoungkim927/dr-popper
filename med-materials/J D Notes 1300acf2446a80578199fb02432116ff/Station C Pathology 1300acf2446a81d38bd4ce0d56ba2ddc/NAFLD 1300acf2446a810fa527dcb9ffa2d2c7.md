# NAFLD

Patient 46yo M - recently diagnosed with diabetes & hypercholesterolemia. Non-smoker, does not use drugs, drinks 4 mid-strength beers every week. Family Hx of cardiovascular diseases (relatives who had died of MI in their 40s), siblings had episodes of MI recently. Liver was palpable. **BMI was 35.** Given LFTs with somewhat elevated AST & ALP (AST/ALT ratio was <1) otherwise normal.

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: NAFLD
        - Given mild elevation of liver transaminases (isolated), AST/ALT < 2
        - Risk factors: high BMI, diabetes, HC, FHx of CVD
    - DDx
        - Other causes of liver injury
            - Alcoholic liver disease
            - Viral hepatitis (chronic)
            - Haemachromatosis
            - Autoimmune
            - Medication induced fatty liver (steroids, amiodarone, MTX)
        - Other causes of hepatic steatosis
            - Starvation
            - Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
- What is NAFLD
    - The presence of hepatic steatosis when no other causes for secondary fat accumulation (e.g. heavy alcohol consumption)
        - Can progress to cirrhosis
    - Divided into:
        - Non-alcoholic fatty liver
            - Hepatic steatosis present without evidence of significant inflammation
        - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
            - Inflammation which may be histologically indistinguishable to alcohol steatohepatitis
    - Most patients are asymptomatic!
        - Some with NASH may complain of fatigue, malaise, RUQ discomfort
        - More likely to present due to incidental finding of elevated AST/ALT or hepatic steatosis detected on abdominal imaging
- How do you diagnose NAFLD
    - Requires all of the following:
        - Demonstration of hepatic steatosis by imaging or biopsy
        - Exclusion of:
            - Significant alcohol consumption
            - Other causes of hepatic steatosis
            - Co-existing chronic liver disease

- Investigative approach to hepatitis and NAFLD
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - LFT (AST, ALT)
            - Not diagnostic however used in FIB-4 score and can detect early cases
        - Imaging
            - Abdominal ultrasound
                - Steatosis characterised by bright liver echotexture and blurring of hepatic vasculature
                - Limited in:
                    - Advanced steatosis (can coarsen hepatic echotexture and blur vascular pattern)
                    - Mild steatosis (low sensitivity)
            - MRI methods (proton-density fat fraction) are more sensitive but less used in routine practice
        - Measuring liver fibrosis and NAFLD severity (correlates with mortality and morbidity)
            - Simple fibrosis scores (Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] index)
            
            ![Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 8.46.03 pm.png](NAFLD%201300acf2446a810fa527dcb9ffa2d2c7/Screenshot_2023-10-03_at_8.46.03_pm.png)
            
            - Ultrasound transient elastography
        - Liver biopsy is not indicated for all patients but if the diagnosis if unclear or to assess the degree of hepatic injury
            - Biopsy is the only test to differentiate from NAFL and NASH
    - Ancillary
        - Bedside
            - Anthropomorphics (height, weight, BMI)
            - BSL (linked with diabetes)
        - Labs
            - FBC (anaemia, thrombocytopaenia)
            - Coags (decreased liver function)
            - BAC and UDS (toxins)
            - Serum lipids (risk factor)
            - Serology
                - IgG-anti HCV or HCV PCR
                - HbsAg, anti-HbsAg, anti-HBc
                - IgG-anti-HAV
            - Iron studies (haemochromatosis)
            - Anti-smooth muscle Ab, ANA (autoimmune)
- Pathophysiology of NAFLD
    - Not fully understood
    - Strongly associated with metabolic syndrome
        - Presence of T2DM and obesity is the best predictor of severe fibrosis and disease progression
    - **Insulin resistance leads to accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes** by at least three mechanisms:
        - Impaired oxidation of fatty acids
        - Increased synthesis and uptake
        - Decreased hepatic secretion of VLDL
    - **Fat-laden hepatocytes are highly sensitive to oxidative stress** and results in apoptosis
        - **Increasing levels of inflammatory cytokines from oxidative stress or released from adipose tissue lead to liver damage and inflammation**

- Macroscopic and microscopic appearance in NAFLD
    - Liver can exhibit steatosis, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis
        - NASH describes overt clinical features of liver injury (elevated transaminases, histological features of hepatitis)
    - Hepatocellular steatosis
        - Macroscopic
            - Large, soft, yellow, greasy liver
        - Microscopic:
            - Fat accumulation originally in centrilobular hepatocytes (closest to central vein)
            - Lipid droplets can be small (microvesicular) or large (macrovesicular) and can displace the nucleus
        
        ![Screenshot 2023-04-23 at 12.11.06 pm.png](NAFLD%201300acf2446a810fa527dcb9ffa2d2c7/Screenshot_2023-04-23_at_12.11.06_pm.png)
        
    - Steatohepatitis
        - Changes are often less pronounced that those seen in alcoholic liver disease
        - **Hepatocyte ballooning**
            - Single or scattered foci of cells undergo swelling and necrosis
        - **Mallory-Denk bodies**
            - Tangled skeins of intermediate filaments (eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in degenerating hepatocytes)
        - **Neutrophil infiltration**
        
        ![Screenshot 2023-04-23 at 12.12.52 pm.png](NAFLD%201300acf2446a810fa527dcb9ffa2d2c7/Screenshot_2023-04-23_at_12.12.52_pm.png)
        
    - Steatohepatitis with fibrosis
        - Distinct pattern of scarring
            - Fibrosis appears first in the centrilobular region (central vein sclerosis)
                - Perisinusoidal scars appear next in the space of Disse (centrilobular region) and spreads outwards to encircle individual hepatocytes
            - Fibrosis eventually involves portal tracts (centra-portal fibrous septa)
                - As these become more prominent, liver takes on a nodular cirrhotic appearance
                - Due to continued insults, the **continual subdivision of nodules by new perisinusoidal scarring leads to a classic micronodular appearance**
        - End-stage cirrhotic liver may become ‘burned out’, devoid of fatty change and other typical features
            - A lot of ‘cryptogenic cirrhosis’ can now be attributed to NASH

- Pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome
    - **Obesity** is associated with resistance to the effects of insulin on peripheral glucose and fatty acid utilisation
        - Often leads to **T2DM**
    - Insulin resistance + hyperglycaemia + adipocyte cytokines leads to:
        - Vascular endothelial dysfunction
        - **Abnormal lipid profile**
        - **Hypertension**
        - Vascular inflammation
        - **All the above contribute to atherosclerotic CVD**
