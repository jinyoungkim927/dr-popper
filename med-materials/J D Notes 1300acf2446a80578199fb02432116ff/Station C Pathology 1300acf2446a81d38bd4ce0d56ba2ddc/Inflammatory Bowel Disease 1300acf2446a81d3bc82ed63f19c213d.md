**Case:** *A 19-year-old female medical student presented to the Emergency Department with severe bloody diarrhoea. The diarrhoea had commenced three weeks earlier and had gradually worsened, so that each day she was passing 8-10 stools containing stringy mucus and blood. The diarrhoea was associated with crampy lower abdominal pain, urgency and tenesmus.*

*On examination, she was pale, thin, lethargic and dehydrated. There was tenderness in the left lower quadrant without guarding or rigidity, and the bowel sounds were increased. Rectal examination revealed no masses, but blood and mucus were evident on the glove.*

- PDx and DDx for bloody diarrhoea
    - PDx: inflammatory bowel disease (likely ulcerative colitis however may be Crohn’s)
        - Protracted 3 week course makes acute infective pathologies less likely
        - Bloody and mucus diarrhoea suggests intense inflammation in the large bowel
            - Crampy lower abdominal pain, urgency and tenesmus suggests rectal pathology

        - Defects in the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium
            - Increased bacterial permeability
        - Exaggerated immune response against commensal organisms normally found in the gut

        - Most likely affects the ileum and caecum
    - Macroscopic - endoscopic
        - Skip lesions - sharp demarcation between normal and abnormal tissue
            - Discontinuous findings throughout the GIT - tends to be rectal sparing
        - Deeper ulcers tend to involve the entire gut wall (contrasts superficial UC lesions)
            - Oral aphthous ulcers more likely to be present
        - Cobblestoning appearance (linear ulcers)
        - Stricture formation (inflammation)
        - Fistulating disease (perianal, genitourinary, gynaecological) → transmural
    - Microscopic - histology
        - **Transmural inflammation**
        - **Non-caseating granulomas**
        - Crypt abscesses present (less prominent than UC)
        - Villus blunting

        - Rectal sparing
- Management approach to UC
    - Goals of treatment
        - Modify the course of disease
        - Treat active inflammation **(induction of remission)**
        - Maintain complete mucosal healing and prevent flares **(maintenance)**
    - Induction therapy → depends on pre-treatment assessment of severity
        - 5-ASA derivatives (e.g. mesalazine)
            - Used more in UC than CD (effective against colitis)
        - Corticosteroids (e.g. rectal hydrocortisone, oral prednisolone, IV methylprednisone)
        - Immunomodulatory drugs
            - Azathioprine or 6-MP
            - Methotrexate
            - Biologics (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab)
    - Maintenance therapy → based on disease and patient factors
        - NO corticosteroids (due to side effects)
        - 5-ASA derivatives
        - Immunomodulatory drugs
            - Azathioprine, 6-MP
            - MTX
            - Cyclophosphamide
            - Biologics
    - Surgical management
        - Potentially curative for ulcerative colitis (remove disease focus)
        - Indicated as prophylaxis for CRC
        - Modify the course of disease
        - Treat active inflammation **(induction of remission)**
        - Maintain complete mucosal healing and prevent flares **(maintenance)**
- Management approach to CD
    
    **Note: 5-ASA derivates and rectal therapy have no significant role in Crohns**
    
    Induction therapy
    
    - Oral corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) OD until response and taper over 6-8 weeks
    - Consider IV if severe CD
    
    Maintenance therapy
    
    - Azathioprine or 6-MP are first line
        - Consider adjuvant allopurinol to minimise AEs (requires reducing thiopurine dose to 1/3 of current dose)
    - Methotrexate is second line
    - Consider biologics for refractory CD (infliximab, vedolixumab - anti-integrin)
    
    Additional
    
    - In perianal or fistulating disease, refer to colorectal surgeon
        - Management with PO metronidazole or ciprofloxacin BD

            - Primary sclerosing cholangitis
- Relationship between IBD and CRC
    - IBD is a known risk factor for CRC (UC > CD)
    - Risk increases with:
        - Increased duration of disease
        - Increased extent of disease
        - Sclerosing cholangitis
    - Risk is cumulative - little increased risk initially
        - 7-15% at 20 years
    - Screening colonoscopy if initiated regularly (depends on disease severity)
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) – what do you make of the following clinical scenario?
    
    *On the sixth hospital day, she complained of **increased abdominal pain** and became **febrile** (39ºC). The **abdomen was distended, tenderness and guarding were prominent in the left lower quadrant**, and **bowel sounds were diminished**.*
    
    - PDx: likely toxic megacolon
        - Total or segmental non-obstructive colonic dilation (> 6cm on radiography with systemic toxicity - leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia))
        - Commonly due to UC but can occur in other states (e.g. pseudomembranous colitis, infective)
    - Clinical features
        - Abdominal pain
        - Abdominal distension, tenderness, guarding
        - Fever, tachycardia
        - Diminised bowel sounds
    - Pathophysiology
        - Severe inflammation throughout muscular layers of colon → release of inflammatory cytokines → cessation of colonic neuromuscular activity
            - Leads to dilation and increased pressure → ischaemia of colon wall
        - Results in:
            - Bacterial translocation → systemic symptoms
            - Gangrene, perforation, peritonitis
    - Management
        - Resuscitation and gastric decompression (+ bowel rest)
        - Needs urgent corticosteroids and treat underlying cause (e.g. ABx)
        - Consider emergency surgical consult
- Aminosalicylates
    - e.g. mesalazine, sulfasalazine
    - Mechanism
        - Mesalazine is a pro-drug metabolised to 5-ASA by intestinal bacteria
            - Blocks arachidonic acid metabolism (via NF-kB) and PG and LT synthesis → anti-inflammatory (decreased IL1, TNF-a, apoptosis of inflammatory cells)
        - Note: sulfasalazine is broken down into mesalazine (5-ASA) and sulfapyridine (antibacterial)
    - AEs
        - Headache
        - GI upset
        - Rash
        - Rarely may cause pancreatitis, hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, agranulocytosis
    - Why mesalazine over sulfasalazine
- Calcineurin inhibitors
    - e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus
    - Mechanism
        - Bind cytoplasmic immunophilins and inhibit calcineurin in T cells
            - Blocks IL-2 production which normally mediates T cell proliferation and differentiation by activation of transcription factors
        - Cyclosporin inhibits cyclophilins
        - Tacrolimus inhibits FKBP-12
    - AEs
        - Opportunistic infections
        - Nephrotoxicity
        - Neurotoxicity
- Biologics in IBD
    - Anti-TNFa inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab)
    - Anti-A4B7 inhibitor (vedolizumab)
        - Inhibits T cell integrin and impaired lymphocyte migration to GIT
    - AEs
        - Infusion related
            - Headache, vertigo, flushing, fever, chills, urticaria, chest pain, dyspnoea
        - Infections, malignancies
- Azathioprine
    - Mechanism
        - Antimetabolite precursor of 6-MP → inhibits purine synthesis → decreases cellular proliferation
    - AEs
        - Myelosuppression → pancytopaenia
        - GI intolerance → diarrhoea, pancreatitis, mouth ulcers, oesophagitis
        - Alopecia
    - Note: 6-MP is degraded by xanthine oxidase → allopurinol causes toxicity

            - **Form three taenia coli in the large intestine → contribute to the haustrations**
        - Note: oblique muscle layer is innermost in the stomach
        - Note: myenteric plexus (Auerbach) located between the circular and longitudinal layers (SNS and PSNS)
    - Adventitia/serosa
        - Contains fat, blood vessels and nerves associated with the GIT
        - Epiploic appendices are present in the colon (small pouches of peritoneum filled with fat)

            - If a patient is already on urate-lowering therapy when they suffer a flare, then it should be continued
        - Indications
            - Joint damage seen on imaging
            - Frequent gout attacks (>2/year)
            - First episode with the following risk factors
                - CKD ≥ stage 3
                - Serum uric acid > 0.5 mmol/L
                - History of urolithiasis
    - Colchicine
        - Mechanism - poorly understood
            - May inhibit microtubule polymerisation and inhibit the function of immune cells (e.g. neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation)
        - AEs
            - GI upset (diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, pain, nausea and vomiting)
            - Haematuria
            - Neuromyopathy (esp in CKD)
            - Peripheral neuropathy
            - Narrow therapeutic window
    - Xanthine-oxidase inhibitors
        - e.g. allopurinol, febuxostat
        - Mechanism
            - Inhibit xanthine oxidase and reduced production of uric acid
                - Hypoxanthine → xanthine → uric acid
        - AEs
            - Rash, hypersensitivity
            - May precipitate gout flare acutely
    - Uricosurics
        - e.g. probenecid
        - Mechanism
            - Blocks the URAT1 transporter in the PCT → decreased reabsorption of uric acid
        - AE
            - May precipitate gout flare
            - Nephrolithiasis
            - Polyuria, dehydration
            - GI upset
    - Recombinant uricase
        - e.g. pegloticase (longer half-life), rasburicase (acute)
        - Mechanism
            - Metabolises uric acid to allantoin (more soluble) → decreased serum uric acid levels and risk of precipitation
        - AEs
            - May precipitate acute gout flare
            - Haemolysis and bleeding
            - Immunogenic effects
- How do azathioprine and allopurinol interact? What enzymes are involved?
    - Azathioprine is metabolised into 6-MP (active form)
        - Xanthine oxidase mediates one pathway of inactivation of 6-MP
        - Thus, inhibition of xanthine oxidase (i.e. allopurinol) will increase 6-MP concentration which can become toxic
            - Toxic effects may include leukopaenia, thrombocytopaenia
    - Check other enzymes such as TPMT

- The man begins to take St John’s wort for his low mood. How does it work? are you concerned about him taking it?
    - St. John’s wort is a flowering plant commonly used as an alternative medicine for depression, anxiety, insomnia
    - Mechanism
        - Not fully understood but thought to be a weak reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline
        - Increases dopamine concentrations (decrease metabolism)
    - Risks
        - Serotonin syndrome → esp. if used in conjunction with SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, TCAs (e.g. sertraline in this case)
        - Induction of CYP450 enzymes
            - Increases metabolism of certain drugs (e.g. warfarin, CCBs)
