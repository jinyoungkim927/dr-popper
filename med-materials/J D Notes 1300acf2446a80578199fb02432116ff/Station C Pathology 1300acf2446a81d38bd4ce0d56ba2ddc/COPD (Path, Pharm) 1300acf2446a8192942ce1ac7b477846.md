**Case:** *A 62-year-old woman developed increasing dyspnoea over 5 years. She had suffered from a chronic cough for "many years”, and had smoked 40 cigarettes/day. There was a past history of pneumonia 3 years previously and recurrent episodes of “bronchitis” over the past 20 years.*

*Examination revealed a thin woman, dyspnoeic at rest and using her accessory respiratory muscles. She was centrally cyanosed with bilateral expiratory rhonchi on auscultation. There was no evidence of clubbing of the fingers. Her cough was productive of copious mucopurulent sputum.*

- Definition of COPD
    - Respiratory condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and chronic airflow limitation, secondary to chronic bronchitis, bronchiolitis (small airways) and/or emphysema
        - Two clinical entities which often develop concurrently in long-term heavy smokers
    - Chronic bronchitis (clinical Dx)
        - Chronic cough, productive of sputum, for ≥ 3 months for ≥ 2 consecutive years
    - Emphysema (pathological Dx)
        - Permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles due to destruction of alveolar walls
- Phenotypes of COPD (examination findings)
    
    
    |  | “Pink puffers” | “Blue bloaters” |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Phenotype | Emphysema predominant | Chronic bronchitis predominant |
    | ABG | CO2 retention (pink) | Hypoxia (cyanosis) |
    | Body habitus | Cachexic, barrel chested | Overweight |
    | WOB | Markedly increased (tripoding, use of other accessory muscles, tachypnoea with pursed lip expiration) | Less marked (RR often normal, minimal ‘distress’ |
    | Sputum production | - | Excessive |
    | Ausculatation | - | Potentially more pronounced wheeze, coarse crackles |
    | Major symptom burden | Breathlessness | Cough and sputum |
- Ix approach to COPD
    - Principal diagnostic Ix to confirm COPD
        - Spirometry demonstrating airflow limitation (FEV1% < 0.7/LLN) which is incompletely reversible after administration with an inhaled bronchodilator
            - Calibrated to age, sex, height
            - Severity (COPD-X system or GOLD system (international)
                - Mild (FEV1 = 60-80% of expected value)
                - Moderate (FEV1 = 40-60% of expected value)
                - Severe (FEV1 < 40% of expected value)

            - ECG → evidence of RHF
        - Labs
            - FBC (polycythaemia from hypoxia, WCC raised with infection)
            - UEC and CMP (poor PO intake, check electrolytes)

    - Staging severity of COPD
        - Staging is based on symptom severity and history of hospitalisations and exacerbations
            - Used to guide therapy initiation and prognostication
        - GOLD staging of airflow limitation
            - Stage 1: mild FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted
            - Stage 2: moderate FEV1 ≥ 50-80% predicted
            - Stage 3: severe FEV1 30-50% of predicted
            - Stage 4: very severe FEV1 < 30%
    - CXR findings in COPD
        - Low sensitivity for diagnosing COPD as only advanced emphysema will display typical changes
            - Useful during acute exacerbation to rule out complications such as pneumonia or pneumothroax

        - Pathophysiology
            - Loss of alveolar SA available for gas exchange
            - Areas of relative hypoventilation caused by small airways disease → air trapping
- Pathology - macroscopic, microscopic, contribution to clinical Sx
    
    combination of: **emphysema + chronic bronchiolitis + chronic bronchitis**
    
    - Chronic bronchitis
        
        
        | Macroscopic | Microscopic | Associated symptoms |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Narrowed airway | Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucous glands  | Wheeze, crackles, cyanosis, dyspnoea |
        | Mucopurulent secretions | Bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy | Gas trapping due to airflow limitation |
        |  | Goblet cell hyperplasia | Blood gas abnormalities  |
        |  | Chronic inflammation |  |
        |  | Fibrosis |  |
    - Emphysema
        
        
        | Macroscopic | Microscopic | Associated symptoms |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Hyperinflated lungs (barrel chest due to air trapping) | Imbalance of protease and anti-protease activity → destruction of alveolar walls without fibrosis | Pursed lip breathing (maintain PEEP - Positve End-exiratory Pressure) Ex to splint airway open) |
        | Honeycomb appearance (variable enlargement of air spaces) | Enlarged alveolar spaces (decreased recoil) | Gas trapping due to loss of elastic recoil |
        |  |  | Blood gas abnormalities  |
        - Note microscopic pattern of disease varies by cause
            - Smoking → centroacinar in upper lobe (proximal acinar)
            - A1 antitrypsin deficiency → panacinar in lower lobes
- Pathogenesis of COPD
    - Smoking contributes to both chronic bronchitis and emphysema
        - Activation of epithelium → release of inflammatory mediators and growth factors
        - Macrophage activation → release of inflammatory mediators and protease activators
        - Inactivation of anti-proteases
    - Chronic bronchitis
        - Smoking causes direct injury to the respiratory epithelium and induces inflammation (activation of inflammatory cells, mediators)
        - Cough, wheeze, dyspnoea
            - Narrowed airways (smooth muscle hypertrophy and peribronchilar fibrosis)
            - Compensatory response by airways aims to trap the increased amount of particulate matter
                - Increases mucous production → chronic cough and mucus plugs
        - Tendency for infections
            - Ulceration and squamous metaplasia of respiratory epithelium leads to loss of innate immunity offered by the cilia and goblet cells
    - Emphysema
        - Imbalance in protease to anti-protease activity due to inflammatory factors (as per above)
            - Production of proteases (e.g. elastase)
            - Oxidative damage to anti-proteases (e.g. alpha-1-antitrypsin)
    - Alveolar damage
        - Net effective of damage to epithelium and endothelium → reduced SA for gas exchange
        - Normal physiological response to poor lung ventilation leads to diversion of blood flow to better ventilated areas to maintain PaO2 within the blood
            - Vasoconstriction to poorly-ventilated areas
            - In COPD, widespread hypoventilation leads to generalised pulmonary vasoconstriction → increased pulmonary resistance → pulmonary HTN → RVH and RHF
    - Loss of lung compliance
        - Normally, with expiratory airflow in smaller bronchioles, the acceleration of the airflow drags the walls of the bronchioles inwards
            - The normal intrinsic elasticity of the airways prevents collapse
        - Net effect
            - Loss of elastic fibres → loss of elastic recoil and lung compliance → collapse of small airways → gas trapping (physiological)
                - Hypercapnia and barrel chest
- Management of COPD
    - Non-pharmacological
        - Smoking cessation
            - Motivational interviewing, psychosocial supports
            - Pharmacological interventions
        - Pulmonary rehabilitation
            - Education, psychological support, exercise
            - Improves symptoms and decreases hospital admissions
        - Home oxygen (long-term) for patients with chronic hypoxaemia
            - Must have ceased smoking for ≥ 4 weeks to be eligible
        - Encourage weight loss if needed (improves dyspnoea) and physical activity
        - Encourage vaccinations (influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal)
    - Pharmacological
        - Aim to improve symptoms, QoL and decrease hospital admissions
            - Consider phenotypes and appropriate management (e.g. bronchitis predominant, emphysema predominant, frequent exacerbator, COPD-asthma overlap)
        - Long-term control
            - LAMA (tiotropium bromide) → first-line, daily
            - LABA added to LAMA if:
                - LAMA alone has failed to control symptoms or contraindicated to LAMA
            - SABA PRN for immediate symptom relief
            - Can consider
                - Inhaled corticosteroids for frequent exacerbator or mixed COPD-asthma phenotypes
                - Macrolides (e.g. azithromycin) for frequent exacerbators
        - Management of acute exacerbation
            - Non-pharmacological
                - Primary survey and concurrent resuscitation as needed
                - O2 therapy - NIV if possible, titrated to 88-92% O2 saturation
            - Pharmacological
                - SABA +/- SAMA (usually not more frequent than 4hourly)
                - Systemic glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone 40-60mg daily for 5-14 days)
                - Antibiotics for infective exacerbations
- Acute bronchitis, major microbial causes, approaches to therapy
    - Definition
        - A self-limiting LRTI, lasts 1-2 wks

            - Coronavirus
            - Influenza A/B
            - RSV
            - Other: M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae
    - Management
        - As most cases are benign and self-limiting → antibiotics usually not indicated
        - Can give symptomatic relief (antitussives, SAMA)
- AECOPD
    - Definition
        - Worsening in px’s sxs beyond day-day variation → leads to a change in medication
        - Tends to be one or more of the following:

        - Non-infectious - 30%
            - Inhalation of an irritant or allergen
            - Drugs (e.g. propanolol)
            - Other medical conditions (e.g. PE, heart failure, aspiration)
    - Management
        - Antibiotics may be helpful if the patient has a bacterial exacerbation which is more likely if:
            - Increased sputum volume
            - Sputum purulence or change in colour
            - Fever
        - Choice of antibiotics (related to disease severity)
            - Amoxicillin 1g BD for 5 days
            - Doxycycline 100mg OD for 5 days
- Long-term cardiovascular and ECG changes which may be present in COPD
    - Cardiovascular
        - Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance due to emphysema and chronic small airway disease
            - Loss of pulmonary capillary bed associated with emphysematous destruction of alveoli
            - Vasoconstriction due to hypoxaemia
            - Inflammation and blood vessel changes (intimal hyperplasia, fibrosis_
        - Chronic pulmonary hypertension increases RV afterload → compensatory RV hypertrophy
            - Cor pulmonale occurs when compensatory mechanisms fail to maintain adequate CO leading to RVF
    - ECG changes
        - Low voltage QRS complexes (typically due to increased air between heart and recording electrodes → dampening effect)
        - Sinus tachycardia (dyspnoea, hypoxia)
        - Right axis deviation due to RVH
        - P pulmonale
            - Peaked P waves in inferior leads (II, III, aVF) with rightward P-wave axis (inverted in aVL)
- Normal structure of the bronchial wall
    - Structure of a bronchus (trachea, primary bronchi)
        - Mucosa
            - Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium
            - Goblet cells
            - Neuroepithelial bodies (thought to have chemoreceptive function)
            - Lamina propria → loose CT with elastic fibres
        - Muscularis
            - Layer of smooth muscle (helps control bronchial diameter)
        - Submucosa
            - Loose CT
            - Irregular plates of hyaline cartilages
                - Help keep airways open during pressure changes
            - Bronchial serous glands (lubricate airways and humidify air)
        - Adventitia
            - Dense CT
            - Bronchial blood vessels
            - Lymphoid aggregates, lymphatics and nerves
    - Structure of intrapulmonary and segmental bronchi
        - Same general histological patterns as primary bronchi
        - As bronchi become smaller:
            - Cartilage irregular
            - Circular smooth muscle develops between cartilage and mucosa
            - Fewer goblet cells
            - Epithelium reduced in height and becomes simple columnar with fewer cilia
    - Structure of bronchioles
        - No cartilage and increased circular smooth muscle
        - Non-ciliated Clara cells (bronchiolar epithelial cells)
        - Lack of goblet cells
    - Compromised function
        - Ciliary function impaired by smoking → inability to clear mucus → infection risk
        - Bronchial glands + goblet cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia → excess mucus production
        - Chronic inflammation and fibrosis of airways → airway limitation
        - Smooth muscle hypertrophy

### Past question: COPD (pathology)

*A 62-year-old woman developed increasing dyspnoea over 5 years. She had suffered from a chronic cough for "many years”, and had smoked 40 cigarettes a day. There was a past history of pneumonia 3 years previously and recurrent episodes of “bronchitis” over the past 20 years.*

*Examination revealed a thin woman, dyspnoeic at rest and using her accessory respiratory muscles. She was centrally cyanosed with bilateral expiratory rhonchi on auscultation. There was no evidence of clubbing of the fingers. Her cough was productive of copious mucopurulent sputum.*

- What is the value of sputum culture and FBCs in an acute exacerbation
    - Sputum culture may yield the causative organism if infective exacerbation
        - Limited as in some cases, cultured growth may only be endemic colonisers
    - FBC
        - Elevated Hb and red cell mass (erythrocytosis) due to chronic hypoxia (polycythaemia)
        - May have raised WCC due to infection
- Type 1 v. type 2 respiratory failure (definition, causes)
    - Type 1
        - Hypoxaemia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg) with normocapnia or hypocapnia (adequate ventilation)
            - Typically caused by V/Q mismatch
                - Reduced ventilation → pneumonia, tumour, lung collapse, obstructive lung disease
                - Reduced perfusion → PE, COPD
            - Other causes
                - Alveolar hypoventilation (low FiO2)
                - Right to left shunt
                - Diffusion defect (increased thickness of alveolar capillary membrane) → pneumonia, ILD, APO
    - Type 2
        - Hypercapnia (> 45mmHg) and generally hypoxaemia → acidosis
            - Due to respiratory failure and poor ventilation
        - Causes
            - Increased airway resistance (e.g. COPD, severe asthma)
            - Reduced effort of breathing and drive
                - CNS depressing agents, sedation
                - Neuromuscular disease
- How does gas exchange occur across the pulmonary vascular bed? What makes up the blood gas barrier?
    - Primary function of the lung is gas exchange which occurs at the blood-gas interface in alveoli
    - Conducting zone (anatomical dead space - volume around 150mL)
        - Trachea → R and L main bronchi → lobar bronchi → segmental bronchi → bronchioles → terminal bronchioles
        - Lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with goblet cells
            - Functions: warming or cooling, moistening, detoxification, trapping pathogens, removing particulate matter
    - Respiratory zone
        - Distal to terminal bronchioles (respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and sacs)
    - Alveoli and blood gas barrier
        - Includes:
            - Surfactant
                - Produced by type II pneumocytes, composed of phospholipids
                - Reduces alveolar surface tension created across the air-fluid level within the alveoli (reduces collapse)
            - Simple squamous epithelium, interstitium, endothelium
            - Plasma, RBC membrane
        - Gases diffuse down their partial pressure gradient
- Briefly describe control of respiration
    - Sensors
        - Central chemoreceptors
            - Location: ventral surface of medulla
            - Respond to changes in H+ in CSF (low pH = increased ventilation)
                - Indicates CO2 levels (potent acute effect, weak chronic effect)
        - Peripheral chemoreceptors
            - Location: carotid and aortic body
                - Afferents carried in Cn IX and X
            - Respond to decrease in arterial pO2 and increased CO2 (and lower pH)
            - Stimulates ventilation due to hypoxia (less sensitive but crucial in COPD)
    - Control
        - Respiratory centres in pons and medulla
        - Automatic respiration generated in the Pre-Botzinger complex
            - Rhythmic depolarisation of neurons to influence depolarisation of phrenic nerve (diaphragm) and hypoglossal (tongue)
            - Can be overridden by voluntary control, limbic system
    - Effectors
        - Inspiratory muscles
            - Diaphragm (increases superoinferior diameter) and external intercostals (increases transverse diameter)
            - Accessory (serratus, pectoralis, SCM, scalenes)
        - Expiratory (normally passive)
            - Internal intercostals
            - Abdominal muscles (rectus abdominus, transversus abdominus, EO, IO)
- Briefly describe process of airflow
    - Inspiration
        - Muscles contract → expansion of thoracic cavity
        - Intrapleural pressure becomes more negative → transpulmonary pressure increases → lungs expand
        - Alveolar pressure becomes subatmospheric and air flows into the lungs until alveolar pressure equals atmospheric pressure
    - Expiration (often passive)
    - Elasticity and compliance
        - Lungs are naturally elastic and tend to return to resting volume after distension
            - Partly due to inter-arrangement of tissue fibres (e.g. elastin, collagen)
        - Compliance (how easy it is for lungs and chest wall to expand)
            - Calculated as change in volume divided by change in pressure over time
                - Increased with ageing, emphysema
                - Decreased with ILD, interstitial fluid, atelectasis, low surfactant
