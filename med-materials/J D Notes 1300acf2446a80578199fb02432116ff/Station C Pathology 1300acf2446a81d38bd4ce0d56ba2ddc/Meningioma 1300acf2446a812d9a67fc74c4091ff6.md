# Meningioma

## Case Protocol 21 – **Meningioma**

*A 44-year-old female clerical worker was brought into the Emergency Department following a “grand mal” seizure of two minutes duration, witnessed by her partner. She had never had any fits before and was in good health apart from headaches that had been present for several months, which she had attributed to the stress of her job. In fact, her employer had dismissed her only one week before, on the grounds that she had become forgetful and slow.*

*She was initially drowsy, with bilateral upgoing plantar responses, though these returned to normal after 4 hours. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.*

*A cerebral CT scan was performed the next day. A 4 cm discrete lesion was noted in the left parietal region. It was uniformly vascular.*

- Hx approach
    - Previous episodes
    - FMHx of seizures
    - head trauma (recent or remote)
    - alc/drug use/w/d
    - meds
    - infections
    - other medical conditions
    - Sleep?
    - nature of the headaches:  where, when
- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: progressive space-occupying lesion given first presentation of seizure, chronic headache and possible cognitive decline
        - Likely neoplastic given insidious onset, lack of infective symptoms
        - Most common neoplasms in adults are metastases, meningiomas, gliomas
    - DDx
        - Vascular (TIA, stroke, AVM)
        - Infective (abscess, meningitis, encephalitis)
        - Metabolic (hypoglycaemia, hepatic or uraemic encephalopathy, hypoNa, hyperNa)
        - Autoimmune (MS, limbic encephalitis, SLE-associated)
        - Substance related (EtOh or BZD withdrawal)
- Signs of raised ICP
    - Late-stage (Cushing’s triad)
        - Systolic hypertension (compensatory response for cerebral autoregulation)
        - Bradycardia (paradoxical compensatory PSNS response)
        - Irregular respiration (? compression of cardiorespiratory centres in medulla)
    - Other
        - Headache (worse when supine, bending, coughing)
        - Vomiting (medullary centres)
        - Decreased LoC
        - Visual changes (papilloedema, extra-ocular muscle abnormalities)
        - Herniation syndromes
- Causes of raised ICP
    - Mass effect
        - Haematoma, abscess, depressed skull fracture
    - Increase in brain volume
        - Generalised swelling or cerebral oedema (e.g. ischaemia, trauma, metabolic)
            - Oedema can be vasogenic (vessel damage), cytotoxic (cell death), osmotic (metabolic)
    - Increased intracranial blood volume
        - Increased blood flow or vasodilation (hypercapnia, hypoxia)
        - Venous stasis (thrombosis, SOL, SVC)
    - Increase in CSF or decreased resorption
        - Hydrocephalus (communicating, non-communicating)

    stroke 
    
    tumour
    
    traumatic brain injury 
    
    toxins/meds/metabolic

- Pathophysiological mechanisms for headache in meningioma
    - Headache due to stretch, pressure or traction on pain-sensitive structures
        - Dura mater
        - Cranial nerves
        - Vessels (arteries - meningeal; venous sinuses)
    - Likely due to an expansile growth of an intracranial lesion or oedema of surrounding tissues
    - Note that the brain parenchyma itself is not nociceptive
- Pathophysiology of cognitive changes (and employment difficulties in case)
    - Employment problems could be a manifestation of subtle changes in neurological function
        - Often due to pathology in the frontal lobe (direct or secondary to raised ICP)
    - DDx
        - Psychiatric illness (e.g. depression, psychotic disorder)
        - Drug and alcohol use
        - Chronic subdural haemorrhage
        - Dementia
- **Other presentations of meningioma:**
- Ix approach
    
    Labs:

    - LP?
    
    EEG 
    
- Principal diagnostic investigations and radiological findings in meningioma
    - Principal diagnostics: up to 30% of ppl who have   first seiuzure show abnormalities on brain imaging
        - CT brain with contrast
        - MRI brain (preferred)
        - EEG for epileptiform activity
    - Radiological findings
        - Peripheral location with invagination into brain parenchyma
            - Round, sharply demarcated extra-axial mass
        - Uniformly vascular (homogenous enhancement)
            - Rapid uptake of contrast (blush sign)
            - Supplying vessels may resemble the spokes of a wheel
            - Suggests benign slow-growing lesion (compared to ring-enhancing with area of central necrosis)
        - Dural tail sign → dural based tumour
            - Dural based lesions
                
                Tumours
                
                Histiocytic/inflamm
                
                Apparently dural based
                
        - May have areas of calcification

*The meningioma was removed surgically and sent to Anatomical Pathology for histopathology. Grossly, the tumour was broadly attached to dura and appeared rounded and well circumscribed, with a vaguely whorled cut surface.*

- Management approach to meningioma
    - Depends on:
        - symptomatic vs asymptomatic
        - confidence in dx
        - growth
        - site
        - size
    - Symptomatic management
        - Analgesia → headaches
        - Seizure prophylaxis (if prev seizure; confirmed raised ICP)
        - Optimise BP, electrolytes, ICP
    - Definitive
        - Resection (first line for primary symptomatic tumours)
            - Usually via craniotomy
            - Can use stereotactic radiosurgery (e.g. gamma knife) for inaccessible lesions or lesions < 3cm
            - Consider whole brain radiotherapy as an alternative or adjunct
        - Dexamethasone
            - Perioperative → shrink tumour size
    - Note: asymptomatic tumours can be managed conservatively with observation : look at growth, site , size
        - If its near the optic canal for example is it going to grow into a region like the optic area that will cause issues
- Common locations for meningioma
    - Can develop anywhere with meninges
    - 90% intracranial
        - Often along dural reflections (e.g. falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, olfactory bulb)
    - 10% spinal

- What are classic histological features of meningioma
    - Macroscopic
        - Rounded, encapsulated mass with well-defined dural base
        - May have calcifications
    - Microscopic
        - mesenchymal origin  → arachnoid cap/barrier cells
        - Whorls of uniform, round, meningo-epithelial bodies → onion peel arrangement
        - Psammoma bodies
            - Small, laminated spherical bodies with dystrophic calcification
        - Evidence of atypical nuclear features in higher WHO grades
- Histological grading
    - Deviation from norm cell morph + behaviour
    - proliferation
    - differentiation
    - Grade 2:
        - increased mitosis
        - 3 of 5 morphological fts:
            - Sheeting
            - small cell change
            - macronuceloli
            - spontaenous necrosis — ?a*reminder to add def to this*
            - hyerpcellualrity
        - **Brain invasion**
    - Grade 3:
        - Less differtianted
        - more mitoses
- WHO classification of meningioma and risk of recurrence? Where is the lesion likely to recur?
    - WHO divides meningiomas into three groups (correlate with prognosis)
        - Grade I (80%) - benign
        - Grade II (15%) - atypical
            - Demonstrates some criteria (increased mitotic activity, brain invasion, high N:C ratio)
        - Grade III (3%) - malignant or anaplastic
            - Most aggressive, most likely to recur
    
    ![Screenshot 2025-06-02 at 1.18.21 PM.png](Meningioma%201300acf2446a812d9a67fc74c4091ff6/Screenshot_2025-06-02_at_1.18.21_PM.png)
    
- Sites of recurrence
    - Often benign
    - local occurrence can occur (particularly in higher grades) → tumours may demonstrate aggressive local extension
    - Local: in - in vasion  brain
        - out L dura —> bone → soft tissue (scalp, orbit , __
    - Distant metastases = extracranial mets - extremely rare
    - 1/5 come back in 20 years even for a grade 1 tumour resected
- RFs for meningioma
    - Largely idiopathic
    - Some a/w ionising radiation exposure (e.g. radiotherapy for head and neck cancers)
        - worse if childhood
        - adult/high dose (atomic bomb, radiotherapy)
        - lower doses eg: CT done age <18 → increase risk
    - Hormones
        - homrone recpetors in meningioma (PR>ER)
        - changes in growth during menstrual cycle pregnancy + breastfeeding
        - HRT, high dose (>50mg/day) cyptroterone acetate - synthetic progestin antiandrogenic
            - base of the skull → convexity → greater PR expression → tumour location?
    - v small risk increase w/ smoking/obesity
    - F:M ⇒ 2:1; esp. spinal cord lesions
    - Decreased risk:
        - breast feeding >6months
        - asthma
        - male
    - Genetic predispositions
        - Genetic helps : location, subtype, prognosis
        - NF2 → can lead to multiple meningiomas
        - MEN1
        
        ![IMG_8423.heic](Meningioma%201300acf2446a812d9a67fc74c4091ff6/IMG_8423.heic)
        
        - EXTRA STUFF FROM TUTE
            - AKT1 (E17K) 12%
                - anterior or middle skull base?
            - Smo mutant (headgehog pathway) 3-5%
                - anterior medial skull base (olfactory groove)
                - worse prognosis of akt1 mutant oflactor groove tumours
            - Note hat enteric variants inform grading (ie behaviour/homozygous loss of CDKN2A or CDKN2B) → changes it to grade 3
            - TERT promoter mutation → change to grade 3
            - Tinia capitis study (fungal infection o fhead? or scalp??)
                - H&N x ray exposure to treat tinia capitis  → 9.5x increase risk of meningioma
                - also found genetic interplay since sme family memebers did not have the treatment but still had meningioma
            - Some inform prognosis but don’t change grade
            - Copy number variations of the genes: this change the risk stratification
            
            - Metholome analysis:
                1. Histological subtype 
                2. grading rs/r stratification  
                
- Relevance of ‘cafe au lait’ spots in this patient?
    - Cafe au lait macules are largely benign but may be cutaneous manifestations of neurofibromatosis (type 1 > type 2)
    - However, NF1 is not associated with meningioma
        - NF2 is associated with meningioma however cafe au lait macules are much less frequent
        - These spots are likely incidental
            - >6 macules, each > 5mm is highly suggestive for NF1
- Neurofibromatosis 1 and 2
    - Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an AD condition caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on Ch17
        - Leads to loss of neurofibromin (a tumour suppressor gene)
        - Clinical presentation
            - Neurofibromas (subcutaneous nodules)
            - Cafe au lait spots (uniformly hyperpigmented)
            - Lisch nodules (pigmented iris harmatomas)
            - Risk of tumours
                - Gliomas (optic pathway, astrocytoma)
                - Soft tissue sarcomas
                - Phaeochromocytoma
    - Neurofibromatosis type 2
        - AD condition with mutation in merlin protein
        - Clinical presentation
            - CNS tumours (meningiomas, ependymomas)
            - PNS tumours (vestibular schwannomas → tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo)
            - Retinal harmatomas, cataracts
