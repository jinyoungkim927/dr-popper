# Acute cholecystitis

## Case Protocol 15 – **Acute Cholecystitis/Gallstones**

**Case:**

*A **51-year-old woman** presented to the Emergency Department with an **eight-hour history of severe upper abdominal pain which radiated around to her back** and was associated with **nausea and vomiting**. On examination she was **distressed** by the pain, with **tachycardia, fever,** and **tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ)**. She had a **past history of episodic epigastric pain**, which on **one occasion was accompanied by jaundice**.*

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: acute cholecystitis
        - Given hx (upp. abdo pain) and exam (tender RUQ, fever, tachycardia)
        - PMHx of similar episodes a/w jaundice
    - DDx (epigastric disease)
        - Abdo
            - **Pancreatitis**
            - **Hepatitis (present with jaundice and diff enzymes)**
            - **PUD**
            - Acute appendicitis (if high caecum)
            - Other biliary disease

                - Cholangiocarcinoma
        - Retroperitoneal
            - Ruptured AAA, aortic dissection
            - Renal (pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis)
        - Life-threatening thoracic pathology
            - Cardiac: MI
            - Pulmonary: pneumonia, pneumothorax
        
        Others: Fitz-hugh-curtis; Herpes zoster 
        
- Define acute cholecystitis
    - acute GB inflamm; typical cause ⇒ cystic duct obstruction by gallstone = acute calculous cholecystitis; acalculous less common
    - characteristic clinical fts:
        - RUQ pain: more severe+longer (>6hrs) than biliary colic; postprandial; radiates to right scapula and/or back
        - +ve Murphy sign
        - fever
        - gaurding or peritonism (= gaurding+rigid+rebound tenderness)

    📌
    
    Acute calculous cholecystitis
    
    Gallstone obstruction → disrupted mucosal barrier → naile salt + lecithin + cytokine induced injury → initially sterile inflamm +/- bacteria later 
    
    majority spontaneous resolution but recur
    
    complicated by px factors, unrelieved obstruction, 2’ bacterial infection, unknown factors → cause complications 
    
    </aside>
    
- Define choledocholithiasis
    - Presence of gallstones w/in CBD
        - May result in obstructive pattern of LFT derangement
        - May be a/w acute cholangitis (not necessary)
- Define ascending (septic) cholangitis
    - Cholangitis = biliary tract inflamm, usually in the setting of choledocholithiasis due to 2’ infection
    - Clinical syndrome characterised by Charcot’s triad
        - **Fever** (to 38.5)
        - **Jaundice** (least common ft.)
        - **RUQ pain** (+/- radiate to back or refer to scapula +/- N/V)
    - **Reynold’s pentad is used for ascending cholangitis**
        - **Charcot’s triad + hypoTN + altered mental status**
- Biliary colic = transient cystic duct obstruction by gallstone
    - CCK stimulates GB contraction → stone (or sludge) forced against GB outlet + increasing intra-GB pressure → pain
        - S: RUQ (occasionally epigastric/LUQ/substernal)
        - O: abrupt
        - C: intense, dull discomfort → often constant (less colicky/not true colic)
        - R: may radiate to back and/or refer to right scapula tip or shoulder
        - A: diaphoresis, N/V, early satiety, bloating dyspepsia
        - T: <6hrs (30mins-6hrs; stone dislodges ⇒ pain relieved)
        - E: +/-postprandial esp post-fatty meals (CCK); nocturnal
        - S: severe
        - nil fever, malaise, peritoneal signs
    - Note: lab and exam findings often normal (visceral pain, no peritoneal signs)

    📌
    
    Cholesterol gallstones pathogenesis: 
    
    bile saturated w/ cholesterol 
    
    GB hypomotility promotes nucleation 
    
    cholesterol nucleation in bile accelerated → hypomotility, Ca, pronucleating proteins 
    
    Mucus hypersecretion → traps cholesterol crystals → aggregate into stones
    
    </aside>
    
    - Formed through a combination of factors
        - Imbalance between stone constituents and solubilising agents
            - Increased cholesterol or bilirubin
            - Decreased bile salts (normally make cholesterol or bilirubin more soluble)
        - GB stasis
        - Nidus for growth (bacteria or epithelial glycoproteins)
    - RFs are based on the above mentioned
- Gallstones RFs
    - Factors related to GB stasis
        - Prolonged fasting or TPN
        - Spinal cord injury
        - Drugs/meds (e.g. somatostatin analogues)
    - Factors related to decreased bile salts
        - Crohn’s (more specific for pigment stones) → likely due to altered enterohepatic cycling
        - Genetics (FHx)
    - RFs for cholesterol gallstones/related to increased cholesterol
        - Excessive hepatic cholesterol secretion → bile salts and lecithin capacity overloads→ precipitates cholesterol
        - The **6 F’s + diabetes or rapid weight loss**
            - Fat (BMI > 30)
            - Fair (Caucasian)

            - Forty (advancing age)
            - Fertile (oestrogen, multiparous, pregnant)
            - FHx (x2 RR)
    - Factors related to increased bilirubin
        - Excess bilirubin precipitates out w/ Ca

    1. Cholecystoenteric fistula = abnormal connection b/w GB lumen and adjacent bowel 
        - GB perforate into intestinal lumen → conduit passage = gallstone into bowel + air into GB
            - Gallstone ileus (mechanical bowel obstruction by gallstone, usually in the terminal ileum; esp. in ileocaecal valve)
            - Pneumobilia (air in biliary tree) → also seen in ERCP, sphincterotomy
    2. **Recurrent or chronic inflammation → adenocarcinoma**

            - Fluid replacement, NBM and bowel rest
            - Antiemetics
    - Analgesics
        - Often NSAIDs used over opioids (produce less spasm of Sphincter of Oddi than morphine)
        - In practice, both used and opioids are more effective
    - Antibiotics
        - Acute cholecystitis is often not septic however there may be superimposed infection (e.g. Klebsiella, E. coli, enterococcus)
        - Abx often given until surgery or resolution of inflammation (prevention of sepsis and surgical site infection)

            - Low surgical risk
                - Recommend early surgery (similar outcomes and complications → shorter hospitalisation and recovery)

- Acute cholecystitis - pathophysiology
    - General
        - Mucosal damage secondary to mechanical injury (gallstones) or ischaemic injury (systemic illness)
        - Release of phospholipase
            - Lecithin is converted to lysolecithin → disrupts protective mucous layer and exposes epithelium to bile salts
                - Emulsification of fats within cell membrane
                - Loss of lecithin = less solubility = more gallstones
            - Prostaglandin production → inflammation (vasodilation + oedema) and increased intraluminal pressure
    - Calculous (90%)
        - Obstruction at the neck of the gallbladder or other part of the biliary tree by a gallstone
            - Distension and mucous hypersecretion → increased intraluminal pressure → impaired blood flow and lymph drainage → mucosal ischaemia → inflammation
        - May have superimposed secondary infection from duodenal bacteria
    - Acalculous (10%)
        - Gallbladder inflammation believed to result from ischaemia secondary to
            - Gallbladder stasis
            - Biliary sludge (microcrystals of cholesterol) [viscous enough to cause pseudo-obstruction
            - Viscous bile and gallbladder mucous
        - Most common in critically ill patients with multiple risk factors:
            - Other risk factors
                - Infection
                - Prolonged fasting
                - TPN

**Anatomy** 

- Biliary tree - general structure
    - Hepatocytes prod. bile → bile canaliculi → portal canals → R + L hepatic ducts → CHD → joins cystic duct → CBD → tracks inf. → enter pancreas post. → travel through inframedially → exit through duodenum @ ampulla of vater
- How does the bile duct form? What are its parts?
    - Arises from the unification of the common hepatic duct and the cystic duct
    - Parts
        - Supraduodenal
            - Anterior to portal vein, R to the hepatic artery
            - Most accessible surgically
        - Retroduodenal
            - Posterior to 1st part of duodenum
            - Slopes down to the R, away from portal vein
            - Anterior to IVC
        - Paraduodenal
            - Lies in the groove between the back of the head of the pancreas and 2nd part of the duodenum
                - Anterior to R renal vein
            - May be embedded in pancreatic tissue
    - Opens into the hepatopancreaticoduodenal ampulla (Vater) by joining the main pancreatic duct (controlled by the Sphincter of Oddi)
        - Connects via the major duodenal papilla to the medial wall of 2nd part of duodenum
- Biliary tract - blood supply
    - Receives branches from the cystic, hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries
- Biliary tree - nerve supply
    - Hormonal control is more important for function (e.g. CCK)
    - Nerves
        - PSNS
            - From the hepatic branch of the anterior vagal trunk
            - Controls gallbladder contraction + sphincter relaxation
        - SNS
            - From T7-T9 nerve roots → greater splanchnic nerve → coeliac ganglion
                - GVA runs with SNS fibres
        - Note: some pain fibres may be carried with the phrenic nerve (irritation of diaphragmatic peritoneum)
- GB - anatomy, parts and relations
    - Function
        - Stores and concentrates bile → 50mL capacity
    - Parts
        - Fundus
            - Related anteriorly to the parietal peritoneum at the tip of the 9th costal cartilage in the transpyloric plane (L1)
        - Body
            - In contact with 1st part of duodenum
        - Neck
            - Superior to the body
            - Continues as the cystic duct
            - **May have a dilation (Hartmann’s pouch) - pathological**
    - Often firmly bound to the gallbladder fossa by CT
        - Carries small veins and arteries from the hepatic bed
        - Occasionally associated with a mesentery

- GB - blood supply
    - Receives many small vessels from the hepatic bed (necrosis is unlikely)
    - Cystic artery (commonly a branch of R hepatic)
        - May arise from the main trunk of hepatic artery, L hepatic or gastroduodenal
        - Passes posterior to cystic duct (usually)
        - Located within Calot’s triangle (common hepatic duct, cystic duct, liver)
- GB - venous drainage
    - Multiple small veins in the gallbladder bed drain to the liver
    - Cystic veins may also be present → enter R branch of portal vein
- GB - lymphatic drainage
    - Primary draining nodes
        - Porta hepatis nodes
        - Cystic node (Lund’s node)
        - Node at the anterior border of the epiploic foramen
    - These nodes will drain to the coeliac group of pre-aortic nodes
- Calot’s triangle
    - Formed:
        - Inferior - cystic duct
        - Medial - common hepatic duct
        - Superior - liver surface
    - Contents
        - Cystic artery
        - Cystic node (Lund’s node)
