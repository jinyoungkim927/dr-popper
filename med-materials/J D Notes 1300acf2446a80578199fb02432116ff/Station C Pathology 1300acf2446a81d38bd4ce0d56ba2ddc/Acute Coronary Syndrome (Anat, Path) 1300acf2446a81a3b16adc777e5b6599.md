# Acute Coronary Syndrome (Anat, Path)

## Case Protocol 9 â€“ **Acute Myocardial Infarction**

*A 58-year-old man presented to his local GP with a two-hour history of severe chest pain. The pain had commenced while running, and was initially associated with nausea, vomiting and agitation. The patient had experienced similar, less severe chest pain while running over the previous three weeks. He had a 27-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus.*

*On examination the man was distressed, diaphoretic and mildly obese. Blood pressure was 165/105 mm Hg, pulse rate 114/min with frequent ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) and there was an S4 heard on auscultation of the precordium. Basal crepitations were audible over both lungs.*

- Pathophysiology of different forms of ACS
    - Ischaemic heart disease occurs due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and oxygen supply
        - Decreased O2 supply (ischaemia)
            - Decreased flow
                - Atherosclerosis with acute plaque change (>90% cases)
                - Less common: coronary artery spasm, aortic dissection, arteritis
            - Decreased oxygenation
                - Severe anaemia, respiratory failure
        - Increased demand
            - Myocardial hypertrophy (2* to chronic HTN), tachycardia, HTN (increased afterload)
        - Most commonly MI is due to a thrombosis overlying an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery
            - Acute thrombi formation occurs due to erosion or fissuring of the atherosclerotic plaque and exposure of the subendothelial collagen and pro-thrombotic necrotic plaque contents to the blood â†’ coagulation cascade â†’ thrombosis

**Case:**

*A 55-year-old male presented to ED with a 2-hour history of central, retrosternal, crushing chest pain and 10-year background of hypertension and 2 weeks of chest pain on exertion resolving with rest. He is obese with a BMI of 35.0. He is tachycardic, tachypnoeic and hypertensive.*

- Where can the heart rupture and likely consequences? When is the most likely time period?
    - Myocardial rupture is most common 3-14 days post infarction (heart is soft due to granulation tissue and activation of phagocytes)
    - Most common locations
        - Left ventricular free wall rupture
            - Cardiac tamponade â†’ obstructive shock and Beckâ€™s triad
            - Pseudoaneurysm (if rupture contained by pericardium or scar tissue)
                - Risk of mural thrombus; decreased CO
        - Interventricular septum rupture
            - Acquired VSD and Lâ†’ R shunt following pressure gradient

        - Papillary muscle rupture
            - Acute mitral or tricuspid regurgitation
                - LVF or APO
- Explain the cause of a pansystolic murmur and elevated JVP after MI
    - Pansystolic murmur post MI may be caused by:
        - Acute mitral regurgitation (papillary muscle rupture)
        - Acute tricuspid regurgitation
        - Ventricular septal defect
    - Raised JVP may be caused by:
        - RHF
        - Tricuspid regurgitation
        - VSD
        - Cardiac tamponade
    - Given both signs together â†’ may suggest VSD or tricuspid regurgitation and increased RA pressures
