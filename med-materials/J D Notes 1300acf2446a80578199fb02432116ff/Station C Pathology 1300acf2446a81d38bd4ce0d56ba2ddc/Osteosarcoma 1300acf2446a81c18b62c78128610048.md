# Osteosarcoma

## Case Protocol 6 – **Osteosarcoma**

*A 13-year-old boy complained of **pain and swelling above his left knee** for the preceding three weeks. He remembered injuring the leg whilst playing football and had not paid much attention to the pain until it seemed to be getting worse. He had also noticed a persistent cough for the past week.*

*Examination revealed a hard swelling above the left knee. The remainder of the examination was normal.*

- What is osteosarcoma and common histopathological features
    - Osteogenic sarcomas are aggressive malignant mesenchymal tumours **characterised by excessive production of osteoid by anaplastic tumour cells**
        - Tends to affect the metaphyses of long bones (distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus)
    - Common features
        - Areas of poorly formed osteoid
        - Areas of anaplasia (numerous mitotic figures, abnormal cell morphology)
        - Areas of vascular invasion
- Approach to MSK examination in knee lump
    - Wash hands
    - Look (compare to both sides) [REDMASS]
        - Rashes
        - Erythema
        - Deformity
        - Muscle wasting
        - Asymmetry

        - Temperature, pulses
        - Swelling (boggy or hard), lump texture and mobility
    - Move
        - ROM
- Investigative approach to osteosarcoma
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - Plain X-ray of affected bone
        - Bone biopsy (IR or orthopaedics)
            - Risk of seeding - perform via 1 muscular compartment only)
        - Given Hx of cough - CXR and sputum MCS
    - Ancillary investigations
        - Bedside
            - Vitals monitoring (SpO2, HR)
        - Labs
            - FBC → anaemia of chronic disease, WCC for leukocytosis
            - CRP/ESR → inflammatory marker
            - LFT, CMP
                - ALP is a marker of bone turnover and tumours
            - LDH - raised in tumour burden
            - UEC - baseline (prior to imaging and treatment)
        - Imaging
            - MRI of the entire involved bone (local staging, preoperative)
            - CT chest, abdomen, pelvis (staging for metabolic disease)
            - Bone scan or PET → metastatic disease staging
- Radiological findings in osteosarcoma
    - Lytic lesions or ”fluffy, cloud-like, moth-eaten mass with indistinct margins
        - Often within the metaphysis
    - Acute periosteal reaction (aggressive disease)
        - **Codman’s triangle**
            - As only the edge of the raised periosteum has time to ossify before subsequent layers are laid down beneath
        - Sunburst pattern (macroscopic)
            - Rapid growth leads to Sharpey’s fibres growing out perendicular to the bone shaft

- General radiologic interpretations of bone lesions
    - Site
        - Intramedullary/central (conventional osteosarcomas) v. surface
        - Epiphysis v. metaphysis v. diaphysis
    - Effect of lesion on bone
        - Lucency - sclerotic v. lytic
            - Homogenous v. heterogenous appearance
    - Response of bone to lesion
        - Margin
            - Well-defined (often benign, sclerotic)
            - Poorly defined (more likely malignant)
        - Presence or absence of periosteal reaction
            - Presence usually suggests malignancy unless benign lesion caused fracture
    - Soft tissues (involvement)
    - Unique characteristics
        - Osteoid - cloud like
        - Fibroid - ground-glass
        - Non-ossifying fibroma - eccentric ‘soap bubble’
        - Simple cyst and fracture - ‘fallen leaf sign’
- Histopathological subtypes of osteosarcoma
    - Osteoblastic (most common)
        - Abundant osteoid and woven bone production
        - Poorly differentiated, pleomorphic and anaplastic cells
    - Chondroblastic
        - High proportion of cartilaginous matrix production
    - Fibroblastic
        - High-grade spindle cell stroma
    - Invasicge , destructive grwoth
    - cellular
    - loss of differentiation
    - nucleas : larger, pleomorophic, irregular neucear broders,
    - crouse chromatin,ig nucleaus, hyperchromitic, high N:C ratio
    - Mitoses (bizzare, multipolar)
- Pathophysiology of osteosarcoma
    - Largely unknown
        - Most are sporadic but some are related to clearly defined genetic events (e.g. Li-Fraumeni, retinoblastoma)
    - Two peaks of incidence with different contributing mechanisms
        - Adolescent (10-20) first peak
            - Mostly males - corresponds with adolescent growth spurt (rapid proliferation within epiphyseal plate - metaphysis)
        - Older peak
            - Often due to secondary diseases (Paget’s disease, fibrous dysplasia)
    
    Heriditary rentionlastoma 1000x fold increased risl 
    
    - There may be an association with viral infection or trauma
- Risk factors for osteosarcoma
    - Non-modifiable
        - Bimodal age distribution
            - Adolescent (13-16 years) → corresponds with growth spurt
            - Age 50 or older (secondary disease)
        - Inherited disease (e.g. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53), Rb gene loss)
        - Bone disease (Paget’s disease, congenital fibrous dysplasia)
        - Prior irradiation or chemotherapy
- Complications and natural history
    - Without treatment → relentless progression with early local invasion and haematogenous spread
        - Common sites: lungs, bone, liver, brain
        - 5 year survival: 70-90%
    - Local invasion
        - Invasion of cortical bone → weakening and pathological fractures
        - Compression of neurovascular structures
        - Joint involvement
- Explanation of cough in osteosarcoma case
    - Concerning for metastatic spread through the haematogenous route → lungs (most frequent site)
    - May be suggestive of other pathology
        - Asthma
        - URTI
        - Pneumonia
