    - Ranson criteria - 11 parameters of alcoholic pancreatitis
        - full Ax can only be done >48h; sensitivity: 70-100%
        - each criteria worth 1pt; composite score **â‰¥ 3 = high risk for severe acute pancreatitis**
        - 11 parameters:

        - Severe  = 7-10 pts/8-10 pts
- Pathophysiology of pancreatitis
    - Incompletely understood but there is thought to be 3 major inciting events (differ in contribution b/w aetiologies)
        1. Pancreatic duct obstruction (ductal cell injury)
            
            
            - ampulla (=pancreatic outflow) obstruction 2â€™ to choledocolethiasis â†’ reflux into pancreas â†’ pancreatic zymogens activated â†’ pancreatic parenchyma destruction â†’ chemoattraction of inflamm cells â†’ inflamm cytokine release â†’ inflamm (pancreatitis)
            - Leads to ischaemia + zymogens accumulation â†’ further damage
        2. Acinar cell injury (infection, alcohol, drugs, enzymes)
            - Leads to release of intracellular zymogens â†’ further damage
        3. Defective intracellular transport (alcohol, metabolic injury)
            - Leads to intracellular activation of enzymes
    - Net effect: **premature intrapancreatic activation and release of degradative enzymes**
        - Trypsinogen â†’ Trypsin â†’ activates enzymes (e.g. proteases, phospholipase, lipases, more trypsin) â†’ pancreatic parenchyma destruction = autodigestion â†’ inflamm cell attracted â†’ inflamm cytokines release â†’ pancreatic inflamm = pancreatitis
        - Results in:
            - Acute inflammation
            - Destruction of pancreatic parenchyma (**proteases**)
            - Fat necrosis (**lipases**)
            - Destruction of blood vessels and interstitial haemorrhage (**elastase**)
            - Systemic release of cytokines (SIRS)
                - cap leakage â†’ Oedema (third spacing) â†’
                    - hypovolaemia â†’ hypoTN, tachycardia â†’ shock â†’ increased necrosis & infections
                    - hypovolaemia â†’ renal hypoperfusion â†’ AKI â†’ oliguria + increased creatinine and BUN
                    - leakage into alevoli + interstitial spaceâ†’ diffuse alveolar oedema â†’ shunting â†’ ARDS â†’ decreased O2 + tachypnoea + increased WOB/use of accessory m.
                - tissue factors â†’ clotting â†’ DIC â†’ increased platelet consumption for clot formation â†’ decreased RBC + platelets AND increased PTT + PT/INR + D-Dimer

- How does pancreatitis cause hypovolaemia and hypoTN
    
    
    Hypovolaemia
    
    - oedema/retroperitoneal haemorrhage â†’ peripancreatic fluid collection â†’ hypovolaemia
    - decreased/no peristalsis â†’ paralytic ileus â†’ fluid collects/trapped in bowel lumen â†’ hypovolaemia
    - vomiting fluid loss â†’ hypovolaemia

    - hypovolaemia â†’ decreased preload + CO â†’ decreased BP
    - SIRS â†’ decreased TPR â†’ decreased BP
    
- Complications of acute pancreatitis
    - Often self-limiting (80% recover w/in 1wk w/o complications)
        - Failure to improve after 5-7 days â‡’ CT (check for local complications)
    - Short-term
        - Local

            - Paralytic ileus
            - Hypocalcaemia (presents w/ tetany)
            - Hyperglycaemia
            - Pulmonary oedema
            - Exocrine dysfunc. (steatorrhoea, loose stools)
            - SIRS
                - ARDS (destruction of surfactant by circulating pancreatic phospholipase)
                - Renal failure
                - DIC (prothrombin activated by trypsin)
        - Long-term
            - Pancreatic pseudocyst
            - Chronic pancreatitis (with recurrent acute attacks)
            - Endocrine dysfunction (diabetes)
            - Enteric fistulas
            
            may eventually â†’ sepsis 
            
- Management paradigm for acute pancreatitis
    - Goals
        - **Provide supportive treatment to reduce risk of progression to organ failure and/or local complications**
        - Optimise patient comfort
        - Treat underlying cause
        - Manage local complications
    - Paradigm
        1. Initial management
            - Primary survey â†’ Ax haemodynamic stability + initiate fluid resus + O2 therapy PRN
            - Analgesia
            - If SIRS + multi-organ failure â†’ T/F ICU
        2. Supportive management
            - Supp O2
            - Fluid resus (haemodynamic stability)
                - Aim = consistent urine output, BP
            - Analgesia (opioids PCA)
            - Enteral tube feeding (Oral when able to tolerate)
            - Antiemetics
        3. Treat underlying cause
            - if gallstone pancreatitis + cholangitis â†’ ERCP w/in 24h
            - Alcoholic pancreatitis â†’ support withdrawal + attempts at abstinence
        4. DVT prophylaxis
- Interpret the following clinical scenario and image: *Whilst the woman made a gradual recovery and was discharged after two weeks, she unfortunately experienced repeated episodes of pain over the next few years. An abdominal X-ray taken four years from the time of initial presentation was reported as showingÂ **calcification**Â in the pancreas. How would this radiological appearance develop?*
    
    ![paste-360782720109ad4745bb92b50967ef31e17bd62b.jpg](Pancreatitis%201300acf2446a81fc9b12f11066ffda0b/paste-360782720109ad4745bb92b50967ef31e17bd62b.jpg)
    
    - AXR shows calcification of the pancreas
        - This is more strongly associated with chronic pancreatitis (due to repeated attacks of acute pancreatitis)
        - repeated exposure to toxin and/or inflammatory mediators â†’ pancreatic stellate cell activation â†’ fibrosis
        - calcification w/ extensive fibrosis + destruction of  gland
    - Calcification occurs due to:
        - Deposition of calcium salts in necrotic areas of the pancreas
            - lipase breakdown peripancreatic and mesenteric fat â†’ free fatty acids released â†’ binds to Ca â†’ white chalky depositions = fatty saponification
        - Calcification of proteinaceous secretions in pancreatic ducts

- Cystic fibrosis and acute pancreatitis
    - CF is caused by an absent or dysfunction CFTR (chloride membrane transporter) gene
        - Results in decreased Cl secretion into the pancreatic duct = decreased osmotic gradient for water
            - Results in more viscous pancreatic secretions which predisposes to obstruction

### Past question â€“ Chronic Pancreatitis (anatomy)

**Case:**

*A 40-year-old man with a past history of alcoholism presents with intermittent epigastric pain, loose stools and unexplained weight loss. May have presented to the Emergency Department complaining of abdominal pain. Has had recurrent symptoms over 3 years. The pain was of gradual onset over the previous four hours and was now severe and confined to the epigastrium.*

    - Definition: prolonged inflamm of pancreas a/w:
        - Irreversible exocrine parenchyma destruction
        - Fibrosis
        - Late stage â‡’ endocrine parenchyma destruction
    - Natural hx (typically)
        
        repeated acute pancreatitis episodes â†’ persistent local cytokine prod. â†’ continued inflamm â†’ over time loss of pancreatic parenchyma (exocrine first, then endocrine late-stage) + fibrosis 
        
- Risk factors for chronic pancreatitis
    - History of alcohol abuse (75% of cases)
    - History of recurrent acute pancreatitis
    - Male (> 40)
    - Smoking
    - FHx
    - Coeliac disease
- Causes of chronic pancreatitis
    - Most common causes
        - Alcohol (70-80%)
        - Idiopathic chronic pancreatitis
        - Recurrent bouts of acute pancreatitis
    - Note: co-factors required usually on top of alcohol
        - E.g. cigarette smoking, high fat/protein diet, genetic predisposition
- Chronic pancreatitis - why do you get loose stools and weight loss
    - Loose stools
        - Due to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency
            - Chronic inflammation leads to destruction and parenchymal tissue and replacement with fibrosis (hence insufficiency)
        - Reduced lipase
            - Increased fat content in stools (steatorrhoea) â†’ oily foul-smelling stools
        - Reduced amylase
            - Impaired CHO breakdown and absorption â†’ osmotic diarrhoea
    - Weight loss (multifactorial)
        - Chronic inflammation
            - Destruction of parenchymal tissue and replacement with fibrosis â†’ exocrine insufficiency
                - Reduced amylase, lipase, protease â†’ impaired absorption of macromolecules and inability to meet metabolic demands â†’ **weight loss**
            - Food avoidance
                - Recurrent pain post-prandially due to release of pancreatic enzymes â†’ food aversion
            - Alcohol
                - Associated with malnutrition
- Chronic pancreatitis - how would you explain hypocalcaemia in the setting of pancreatitis
    - Hypocalcaemia frequently occurs (likely due to precipitation of calcium salts)
        - Note: calcium is largely albumin bound (only ionised calcium is of physiological importance)
    - Note: **in pxs w/ hypoalbuminaemia (e.g. protein malabsorption due to chronic pancreatitis)** total serum Ca conc. will drop â†’ may not accurately reflect physiologically imp. ionised/free Ca conc.
        - Hence, important to calculate corrected calcium
            - E.g. corrected calcium (mmol) = (0.02 x (40 - patient albumin)) + serum Ca [RCPA]
- Chronic pancreatitis - what fts would support a dx of chronic pancreatitis
    - Supportive fts
        - Pain: characteristic + in right location
        - Presence of RFs: Alcohol abuse, Smoking, Hypertriglyceridaemia
        - Loose stools (steatorrhoea + osmotic diarrhoea)
    - Fts supportive of chronicity
        - Weight loss (not expected from isolated acute pancreatitis)
        - Recurring Sxs >3yrs
        - Calcification on XR/CT
        - PMHx of recurrent pancreatitis
- Chronic pancreatitis - how do you explain the following clinical scenario: *Over the next two hours the patient became hypotensive, with pale cold extremities. The serum biochemistry was as shown.*

    - Summary of clinical scenario
        - Hypotension with reduced peripheral perfusion
            - Peripancreatic fluid collection
            - Sequestration of fluid in bowel lumen due to paralytic ileus
            - SIRS
        - Biochemistry
            - Raised BSL (impaired insulin + stress)
            - Elevated UEC (renal hypoperfusion)
            - Hypocalcaemia (fat necrosis = precipitation of calcium salts)
            - Elevated amylase (> 3x ULN)
- Complications of chronic pancreatitis
    - Severe chronic pain
    - Pancreatic insufficiency
        - Endocrine: diabetes
        - Exocrine: malabsorption of fat and protein
    - Increased risk of pancreatic cancer
    - Biliary obstruction
    - Duodenal stenosis
- Chronic pancreatitis - histopathological findings
    - Macroscopic
        - Pancreas is hard (due to fibrosis)
            - May have visible calcified concretions
            - May have visibly dilated ducts
    - Microscopic
        - Reduced number and size of acini
            - May see chronic inflammatory infiltrate around remaining lobules and ducts
        - Parenchymal fibrosis
        - Variable dilation of pancreatic ducts
            - Ductal epithelium may be atrophied or hyperplastic or exhibit squamous metaplasia
            - Ductal concretions may be noted
        - Relative sparing of islets of Langerhans until late
            - Remaining islets become embedded in sclerotic tissue and may fuse or appear enlarged
- Signs of hypoCa
    - Tetany â†’ involuntary muscle contractions
    - Trousseauâ€™s sign
        - Flexion of the wrist, MCPs + extension of IPs + thumb adduction following inflation of BP cuff > 20mmHg of SBP for 3-5 mins
    - Chvostekâ€™s sign
        - Contraction of ipsilateral facial muscles triggered by tapping on the facial nerve

Random notes from biomed tute: 

CT better than US b/c of retroperitoneal anatomical position 

 

DM due to chronic panc vs T2DM (not just purely insulin resistance but multi-endocrine dysfunction)

MRCP - imgs duct very well; cons = $$$

ERCP - basket and get biopsy â†’ useful
