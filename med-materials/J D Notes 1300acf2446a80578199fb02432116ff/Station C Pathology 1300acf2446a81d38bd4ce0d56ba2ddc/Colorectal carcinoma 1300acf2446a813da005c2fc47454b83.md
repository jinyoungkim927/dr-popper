# Colorectal carcinoma

*A 78-year-old male presents to ED with fatigue, weight loss and some blood per rectum. He had also experienced tenesmus and had not seen his GP for about 5 years. On PR examination, there was a firm non-tender mass felt on the anterior wall.*

- CRC - what factors influence prognosis
    - Patient factors
        - Age, comorbidities, functional reserve
    - Disease factors
        - Staging
            - Most important indicator of prognosis is pathological staging after surgical resection
                - Poor factors: residual disease, distant metastasis, node positive
            - For patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy, post-treatment staging is more useful than pre-treatment (especially rectal pathology)
        - Grading
            - High grade = poorer prognosis
        - CEA levels (at time of diagnosis)
        - Genetics (MMR, BRAF, RAS)
        - Presence of complications
- CRC - complications
    - Local
        - **Bleeding** → iron deficiency anaemia
        - **Bowel obstruction** → third spacing (shock), perforation, peritonitis, sepsis
        - Malabsorption → fluid and electrolyte imbalances
        - **Fistula** (e.g. vesicorectal)
    - Disseminated
        - Metastases → lung, liver, bone, brain
    - Systemic
        - Cachexia
        - VTE and PE
        - DIC
    - Treatment-related
        - Surgical site infection
        - Haemorrhage
        - Febrile neutropaenia (if chemotherapy given)
- CRC - staging and grading
    - Staging
        - TNM system → grouped from Stage I to Stage IV based on:
            - Tumour (depth of invasion)
                - Tis = confined to mucosa (in situ)
                - T1 = submucosa invasion
                - T2 = muscularis propria
                - T3 = invades through propria to pericolorectal tissues
                - T4 = invades through visceral peritoneum, may adhere to adjacent structures
            - Nodes (involvement of regional nodes)
                - 0 = no nodes
                - 1 = 1-3
                - 2 = ≥ 4
            - Metastases (involvement of distant organs)
                - Worse is peritoneal metastases + organ metastases (1c)
            - Staging by TNM system

- CRC - pathogenesis
    - Colorectal carcinoma are malignant neoplasms arising from the epithelium of the colon or rectum → majority are adenocarcinoma
        - There are two pathways
    - Adenoma-carcinoma sequence (APC/B-cateinin)
        - Accounts for 80% of sporadic CRC
            - Often tubular or tubulovillous adenocarcinomas
        - Sequence:
            - Two hits to APC tumour suppressor gene (germline/somatic + somatic)
            - Loss of negative regulation of B-catenin and accumulation of B-catenin
                - Proliferation and adenoma formation
            - Accumulation of other mutations (KRAS → proto-oncogene; p53)
                - Further proliferation, apoptosis resistance, dysregulated signalling, dysplasia
                - Results in carcinoma
        
        ![clip_image002-a0cc6c4a24b3d7beb0766997f5e75ee05d799bff.png](Colorectal%20carcinoma%201300acf2446a813da005c2fc47454b83/clip_image002-a0cc6c4a24b3d7beb0766997f5e75ee05d799bff.png)
        
    - Microsatellite instability
        - DNA mismatch repair pathway (accounts for 20% of CRC)
            - Often sessile serrated adenocarcinomas
        - Sequence:
            - Germline (small minority → HNPCC) or somatic mutation in repair pathways (e.g. MSH2, MSH6)
            - Microsatellite instability and accumulation of further mutations (genetic hypermutability)
            - Accumulation of mutations which promote proliferation, suppress apoptosis, dysregulated signalling
                - Cancer

        - Disruption of glandular architecture
        - Cells with high N:C ratio, nuclear pleiomorphism, hyperchromasia
        - Abnormal and abundant mitotic figures
        - Evidence of cells invading through various layers of the wall
- CRC - management paradigm
    - Management is individualised based on patient factors and disease factors

        - Stoma nurse
    - Definitive
        - Depends on location and staging
            - Colon cancer = surgery + adjuvant chemotherapy
            - Rectal cancer = surgery + neoadjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy
        - Surgery
            - Remove tumour along with adequate resection of margins and regional lymph nodes
                - Continuity is restored by anastomosis where possible (may require a temporary colostomy or ileostomy)

        - Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy
            - Oxaliplatin-based or fluoropyrimidine-based
            - Radiotherapy plays a bigger role in rectal cancer
        - Palliative care input + pain management
- CRC - how does colorectal cancer spread?
    - Local spread
        - Depends on the location of the original tumour
            - May involve pelvic organs (e.g. uterus, prostate, urinary bladder)
    - Lymphatic spread
        - SMA or IMA nodal drainage (R v. L sided)
        - Rectal nodes → superficial inguinal → external iliac → common iliac
    - Haematogenous
        - Portal venous system → liver
        - Distal rectum → inferior rectal vein → IVC → lungs
        - Other → brain, bone, peritoneum
- CRC - how do R and L sided tumours differ?
    - Clinical manifestations of CRC differ based on location
        - Partially as faecal contents change consistency over the passage of the bowel (more fluid proximally, more solid distaly)
    - Presentations
        - R sided
            - Anaemia (occult bleeding), fatigue
            - Weight loss
            - Signs of metastases at presentation (e.g. dyspnoea, RUQ pain)
        - L sided
            - Change in bowel motions (constipation + overflow diarrhoea)
            - Haematochezia
        - Rectal lesion
            - Tenesmus
            - Incontinence
            - Blood and/or mucus in stool

- CRC - role of pathologist in the removal of this cancer
    - Main roles
        - Diagnosis of the cancer via examination of biopsy specimens
        - Grading of the cancer depending on differentiation
        - Examination of the resected specimen to determine prognosis through pathological staging

- Investigative approach to microcytic hypochromic anaemia
    - Recall causes: iron deficiency, anaemia of chronic disease (late), thalassaemias, sideroblastic anaemia
    - Principal investigations
        - Iron studies
            - Serum iron, transferrin, transferrin %, ferritin
                - Low ferritin is most specific for iron deficiency
        - Blood smear
            - Sideroblastic anaemia
                - RBCs with basophilic stippling
            - Thalassaemia
                - Target or teardrop cells
        - Serum B6 → sideroblastic anaemia
        - Hb electrophoresis → determines thalassaemia

- Anaemia of chronic disease (pathophysiology, findings)
    - Anaemia of chronic disease is thought to be an evolutionary defence against infection (may be normocytic - early, or microcytic - late)
    - Pathophysiology
        - Inflammation → increased IL-6 → increased hepcidin (acute phase reactant)
            - Hepcidin binds to ferroportin on intestinal mucosal cells and macrophages
            - Results in the decreased release of iron from macrophages and decreased iron absorption from gut
        - Functional sequestration of iron → impaired RBC production
    - Findings
        - Low iron
        - Low transferrin (negative acute phase reactant)
        - High ferritin
            - May physiologically decrease iron availability for scavenging micro-organisms
        - Normocytic or microcytic anaemia
- Interpreting iron studies
