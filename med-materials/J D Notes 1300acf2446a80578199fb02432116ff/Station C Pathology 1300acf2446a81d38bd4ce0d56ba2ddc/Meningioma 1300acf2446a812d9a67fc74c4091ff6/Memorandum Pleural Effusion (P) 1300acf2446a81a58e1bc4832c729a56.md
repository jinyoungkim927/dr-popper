# Memorandum: Pleural Effusion (P)

**Case:** *A 55-year-old female with a past history of breast cancer presents with haemoptysis and dyspnoea. She has a 3-month history of fever, fatigue and 6kg weight loss. She is a non-smoker. On respiratory examination, there is stony dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds bilaterally*

- Differentials for pleural effusion
    - Pleural effusion is a sign and not a diagnosis
        - Given the past Hx of cancer, haemoptysis and constitutional symptoms, pleural effusion secondary to metastases is PDx
    - Most common causes of pleural effusion
        - Congestive heart failure
        - Pneumonia
        - Malignancy
    - Other causes
        - Exudative
            - Infective (pneumonia, TB)
            - Malignancy
                - Primary (direct spread of bronchogenic carcinoma, mesothelioma)
                - Secondary (metastases)
            - Inflammatory (RA, SLE)
            - Infarction (PE)
            - Local trauma or surgery
        - Transudative (increased hydrostatic pressure, decreased oncotic pressure)
            - Nephrotic syndrome
            - Hypoalbuminaemia
            - Cirrhosis
            - CCF
            - Malnutrition
            - Renal failure
        - Chylothorax
            - Accumulation of chyle due to blockage of thoracic duct (e.g. tumour) or trauma/surgery
- Definition and clinical symptoms
    - Definition
        - Collection of fluid between the parietal and visceral pleura.
        - Effusion is an excess accumulation of this fluid caused by:
            - Too much fluid being produced
            - Not enough fluid removed
        - Note: there is a thin layer of pleural fluid  always present for lubrication and ease of movement of the lung during inspiration and expiration.
    - Clinical presentation
        - Dyspnoea (decreased lung volume and reduced expansion)
        - Decreased chest expansion
        - Stony dullness to percussion
        - Reduced air entry over effusion site
            - May have bronchial breath sounds due to atelectasis
        - Decreased vocal resonance
    - Associated signs (cause-related)
        - Pleuritic chest pain, cough (productive or non-productive)
        - Bilateral dependent pitting oedema (CCF)
- Investigative approach for pleural effusion
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - Pleural ultrasound (can be bedside)
            - More sensitive and specific than CXR
            - Useful for guiding thoracocentesis (diagnostic and therapeutic)
        - CXR (PA and lateral view)
            - General findings: blunting or loss of costophrenic angles + meniscus
                - Lateral view is able to detect smaller effusions when compared to PA view
            - Can visualise underlying pathology
        - Thoracocentesis
            - Order serum protein and serum LDH (Light’s criteria)
            - Perform additional testing to explore suggested cause
                - Cytology (malignancy)
                    - Sensitivity best for adenocarcinoma > SCLC > squamous cell
                - pH
                    - Normal is around 7.6
                    - Exudative < transudative
                - Glucose
                    - Low pleural fluid glucose (<3.33mmol/L) or effusion glucose : serum glucose < 0.5 makes malignancy, infection or inflammatory (RA, SLE) more likely
                - Triglycerides
                    - If > 110mg/mL = chylothorax
                        - Fluid looks turbid macroscopically
                - MCS
                    - Infectious causes (pneumonia, empyaema)
                - RCC
                    - 1-20% (cancer, PE, pneumonia)
                    - >50% (haemothorax)
                - WCC
                    - Neutrophils (infectious)
                    - >50% lymphocytes (malignancy, TB, chylothorax)
                    - < 90% (lymphoma)
    - Light’s criteria
        - Used to determine if fluid is more likely transudate or exudate
        - Fluid is more likely EXUDATIVE if any of the following  are present:
            - Effusion protein : serum protein > 0.5
            - Effusion LDH : serum LDH > 0.6
            - Effusion LDH > 2/3 ULN for serum LDH
        - Needs to be paired with clinical picture (can overestimate effusion and misdiagnose in 15%)
    - Ancillary investigations
        - Bedside
            - Blood gas (hypoxaemia)
            - Sputum MCS (if relevant)
                - Rule out infective causes, AFB (TB)
            - ECG (baseline and ? CHF)
        - Labs
            - FBC (anaemia of chronic disease (malignancy), leukocytosis in infection)
                - LFT, ALP, CMP (liver or bone metastases)

- Pathogenesis of pleural effusion
    - Normal physiology
        - Around 20mL of fluid in the pleural space
            - 15mL approximately cycles through via capillaries in the parietal pleura and drained by lymphatics
    - Pathophysiology grouped by mechanism of fluid accumulation
        - Increased fluid entry
            - Increased hydrostatic pressure (fluid overload from CCF, ESKD)
            - Decreased plasma oncotic pressure
                - Secondary to liver failure, malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome
            - Increased capillary permeability (exudative)
                - Inflammation, infection, malignancy
        - Decreased fluid drainage
            - Intrinsic factors (failure of lymphatic structures)
                - Iatrogenic (radiation-induced injury)
                - Malignant infiltration
            - Extrinsic factors (failure of other mechanisms)
                - Static (fibrosis or fibrin deposition of pleura)
                - Dynamic
                    - Limited respiratory motion (muscle paralysis, respiratory fatigue)
                    - More negative intrapleural pressure (atelectasis)
                    - Increased systemic venous pressure
    - Relation to clinical findings
        - Fluid accumulation impairs lung expansion and adequate ventilation and oxygenation —> dyspnoea
- How is pleural fluid drained (A)
    - Drainage of visceral and parietal pleura is different
        - Visceral
            - Dense network of lymphatics —> **bronchial lymph vessels of the lung parenchyma —>**  tracheobronchial lymph nodes → **paratracheal** → bronchomediastinal trunk → thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct
        - Parietal
            - Drains along intercostal spaces → **parasternal lymph nodes** → bronchomediastinal trunk → thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct
- Management of pleural effusion
    - Initial management
        - Check stability of patient
        - Primary survey (A-E) and commence supplementary O2 therapy if needed
    - Symptomatic management of pleural effusion
        - Therapeutic thoracocentesis (drains fluid, allows re-expansion)
            - Consider chest drain if significant effusion
            - Consider pleurodesis (talc —> irritation and adhesion of pleura) in palliative cases
        - Do not drain too rapidly as it can induce pulmonary oedema (within 24h)
        - Complications
            - Vascular injury - haemothorax
            - Pneumothorax
            - Site infection
    - Definitive management - identify and treat underlying cause
        - Local causes
            - Infection
                - Pneumonia - empiric IV antibiotics, sputum or pleural MCS
                - Empyaema
                    - Consider drainage and antibiotics
            - Malignancy
                - Complex and variable (MDT)
            - Infarction
                - Anticoagulation
        - Systemic causes
            - CCF: diuretics and manage fluid overload
            - Renal failure: dialysis
            - Correct hypoalbuminaemia or protein malnutrition
