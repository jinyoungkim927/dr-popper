# Ischaemic Stroke

## Case Protocol 34a – Stroke (**lacunar**)

*A 65-year-old female, who had a 10-year history of hypertension and a myocardial infarction three years previously, presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of weakness in the left arm and leg. On examination, her pulse was rapid and irregularly irregular. She had a left VII cranial nerve palsy of the upper motor neuron type and left spastic hemiparesis, with an ipsilateral upgoing plantar response.*

- PDx and DDx, summary of findings
    - Summary of findings
        - UMN type weakness (spasticity, hyperreflexia) in the whole left body and lower face
        - No sensory or cortical findings (aphasia, agnosia)
    - PDx: stroke of the posterior limb and genu of the right internal capsule
        - May be caused by pathology affecting the lenticulostriate perforators from M1
            - Intracerebral haemorrhage (mostly related to hypertension - rupture of Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms)
            - Lacunar infarct (due to lipohyalinosis or microatheroma)
        - May be a stroke of other vessels

            - Hypoglycaemia
- Lacunar infarcts
    - Definition and common locations
        - Lacunar infarcts are small, non-cortical infarcts caused by occlusion of a penetrating branch from a large cerebral artery
            - Ischaemic, not haemorrhagic
        - Occur most commonly in the following locations (similar to ICH)
            - Pons and midbrain (penetrating arteries from basilar)
            - Thalamus (thalamostriate perforating arteries from PCA)
            - Basal ganglia and internal capsule (lenticulostriate perforators from MCA)
        - Note: these vessels arise from larger vessels at right angles (more vulnerable to hypertension)
    - Pathogenesis
        - Small vessel disease which results in vessel narrowing and also predisposes to small haemorrhages (risk factors - poorly controlled HTN, DM)
            - Lipohyalinosis
            - Hyaline arteriosclerosis
            - Small vessel atherosclerosis
        - Results in interruption of blood flow → downstream metabolic failure (low O2, glucose, ATP) and liquefactive necrosis
    - Clinical features
        - Highly predictive clinical syndromes for lacunar strokes include:
            - Pure motor hemiparesis
            - Pure sensory stroke (rare, often with thalamic infarction)
            - Sensorimotor stroke (motor and sensory fibres in posterior limb of internal capsule)
            - Ataxic hemiparesis
            - Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome
        - Absence of cortical signs (e.g. aphasia, agnosia, neglect, apraxia)
- Risk factors for stroke
    - Similar to risk factors for atherosclerosis and acute MI
    - Non-modifiable
        - Older age
        - Male sex

            - Mass effect (haematoma) or cerebral oedema
- Complications of stroke
    - Neurological
        - Haemorrhagic transformation of ischaemic stroke
        - Ischaemic transformation after SAH
            - Due to vasospasm (4-14 days post-bleed)
        - Recurrent haemorrhage or extension of ischaemia
        - Raised ICP → herniation

- Measuring stroke severity
    - Modified Rankin scale used to quantify the degree of disability and dependence in daily activities after a cerebral stroke
        - 0 = no symptoms
        - 1 = symptoms, no disability
        - 2 = slight disability (unable to do previous activities, able to look after own affairs)
        - 3 = moderate disability (needs assistance, independent ambulation)
        - 4 = moderate/severe disability (needs assistance for ADLs)
        - 5 = severe (bedridden, requires constant care)
        - 6 = death
- Autopsy findings in stroke
    - Liquefactive necrosis occurs in the brain (as opposed to coagulative necrosis) due to higher concentration of intracellular lysosomes (digestive enzymes) and less structural components in neural tissue)
    - Note:
        - Pykonosis → irreversible condensation of chromatin in cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis
        - Nissl bodies → discrete granular structures consisting of rough ER
    - Other findings
        - Heart → may seen signs of emboli, old infarcts or mural thrombi
            - LVH with systemic hypertension
        - Vasculature → atherosclerosis (especially in carotid)
        - Retina or kidneys (hypertensive change)
        - Lungs → consolidation (pneumonia) or changes with PE (if contributory)
    
    | Time (post-infarction) | Macroscopic | Microscopic |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 12-24h | No abnormality detected | Red neurons (pykonosis, loss of Nissl bodies). Demyelination. Early oedema (cytotoxic or vasogenic) |
    | 2-10 days | Necrotic tissue appears pale and soft → blurring of cortico-medullary junction. Severe oedema (peak at 2 days) | Leukocyte infiltration + lipid laden macrophages. Liquefaction. Early reactive gliosis (astrocytes proliferate, enlarge and produce more processes to wall off the infarction) |
    | 10-21 days | Tissue liquefies and starts to leave a fluid filled cavity. Oedema decreased | Ongoing reactive gliosis, scattered blood vessels |
    | months-years | Thin-walled cyst with thickened meninges | Cyst with rim of glial fibres produced by reactive astrocytes and macrophages. Healing by gliosis is preferred over contractile fibrous granulation tissue (no distortion of surviving architecture) |

## Case Protocol 34b – Stroke (**MCA**)

*A 70yo woman is brought into ED after she was found by her husband with an inability to speak, right sided weakness (arms > legs) and right sided lower facial droop. Six months ago, she had had 5 minutes of transient loss of vision in her left eye. Her BP is 140/110mmHg.*

- Localise this lesion and is it more likely to be thrombolic or embolic
    - Summary of case:
        - R sided weakness of arm and face
        - Speech problem (?aphasia)
        - Preceding episode of amaurosis fugax
    - Given the R sided hemiplegia
        - Cortex in left MCA territory or L posterior limb internal capsule
        - Given the aphasia → more likely cortex
    - The previous episode of transient visual loss suggests thromboembolic cause
        - Consistent with carotid atherosclerosis (over cardiac course)
        - MCA thrombosis is less likely given previous TIA and involvement of the ophthalmic artery is a different circulation (ACA)
- What causes amaurosis fugax? What causes it?
    - Definition: transient painless monocular (or binocular) visual disruption
        - Ischaemia to the retina, optic nerve or both is the most common cause (specific type of TIA)
    - Causes
        - Ischaemic
            - Thromboembolism from ipsilateral carotid atherosclerosis (enters ophthalmic artery)
            - Hypoperfusion from fixed severe carotid stenosis
                - More likely to present with recurrent episodes related to reduced ocular perfusion pressure
            - Other
                - Systemic hypoperfusion, vasculitis (temporal, polyarteritis nodosa)
        - Non-ischaemic
            - Optic neuropathy
            - Retinal migraine
- Explain incomprehensible speech? Discuss types of aphasia and causes of dysarthria
    - May be due to cortical deficit (aphasia) or mechanical deficit (dysarthria)
    - Expressive aphasia
        - Lesion to dominant side’s inferior frontal gyrus → MCA superior division
        - Findings
            - Impaired speech production → non-fluent, aggramatical, sparse speech
            - Abnormal prosody (rhythm)
            - Relatively preserved comprehension or insight
            - Impaired repetition
    - Receptive aphasia (Wernicke’s)
        - Lesion to dominant side’s (posterior superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus) → MCA inferior division
        - Findings
            - Poor comprehension (and often poor insight of condition)
            - Normal cadence and intonation (fluent speech) but nonsensical
            - Impaired repetition
    - Conductive aphasia
        - Lesion to arcuate fasciculus within parietal lobe)
        - Intact comprehension and accurate fluent speech production
        - Impaired repetition with paraphrasing
    - Anomic aphasia
        - Lesion to posterior inferior temporal gyrus of dominant temporal lobe
        - Findings → difficulty with word finding
    - Dysarthria
        - Condition of impaired articulation due to motor or neurological dysfunction of tongue, lips or vocal cords
        - Causes
            - Facial motor cortex lesion
            - Lesion to vagus nerve (laryngeal muscles)
            - Muscular disorder of larynx, mouth, oropharynx
- Interpret imaging findings for infarction
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-06-30 at 12.54.34 pm.png](Ischaemic%20Stroke%201300acf2446a81a8882dd2faab5b00b2/Screenshot_2023-06-30_at_12.54.34_pm.png)
    
    - Non-contrast CT is used initially to exclude haemorrhage
    - Findings can be useful in the assessment of ischaemic stroke
        - Hyperdense vessel sign → thrombus (often in MCA)
        - Early infarct signs (subtle)
            - Loss of grey-white matter differentiation
            - Sulcal effacement
            - Focal parenchymal hypodensity
            - Obscuration of Sylvian fissure
    - On CT (axial, non-contrast)
        - Significant area of hypodensity in the left temporal lobe
        - Cerebral oedema, compression of lateral ventricle and some sulcal effacement
- Pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke
    - Acute interruption of blood flow → deprivation of oxygen and glucose in the vascular territory supplied → triggers cascade of events at a cellular level → cell death
    - Mismatch between cerebral blood flow and metabolic demands (O2, glucose) leads to:
        - Anaerobic metabolism (if sufficient glucose) → lactic acidosis → neuronal damage
        - Electrical failure and pump failure
            - Phospholipid breakdown into AA (inflammation)
            - Free radical formation and neuronal damage
    - Sequence of events
        1. Focal ischaemia = decreased neuronal ATP production
        2. Altered ion transport (increased intracellular Na and extracellular K) leading to cytotoxic swelling and depolarisation of neurons
        3. Rise in intracellular [Ca] with release of excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate) and phospholipase activation (increased free radical production)
        4. Free radicals and lactic acidosis (anaerobic) damages cell membranes, proteins and DNA causing irreversible cell injury and liquefactive necrosis

## Case Protocol 34c – Stroke (**PCA**)

*A 62yo man comes to clinic with visual problems and a terrible headache which began earlier in the day. He reports bumping into objects and not being able to read half the printed page of the newspaper. He has a history of HTN and diabetes. On exam, there is right homonymous hemianopia with right face and limb sensory loss. A CT brain non-contrast is performed.*

- MRI sequences used and findings in stroke
    - Hyperacute (minutes)
        - Diffusion weighted imaging
            - Hyperintense signal (intracellular water increased in stroke and diffusion restricted)
        - Apparent diffusion coefficient
            - Hypointense in stroke (decreased water diffusion)
            - Hyperintense in vasogenic oedema (also in DWI)
        - Other sequences are sensitive for haemorrhage but won’t show ischaemic changes
    - Acute (hours)
        - High signal on T2
        - Hyperintense on T2 FLAIR
    - Chronic
        - T1 → low signal
        - T2 → high signal
    - Note: perfusion weighted imaging quantifies the amount of MR contrast agent reaching the brain after intravenous bolus
        - DWI-PWI mismatch → larger area of ischaemic but salvageable tissue (ischaemic penumbra) with core of critical ischaemia
