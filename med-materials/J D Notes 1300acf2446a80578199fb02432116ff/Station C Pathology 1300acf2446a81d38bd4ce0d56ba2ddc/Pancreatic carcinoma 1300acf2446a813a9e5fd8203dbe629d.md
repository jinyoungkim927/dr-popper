    - GIT
        - Epigastric pain or discomfort
        - Obstructive jaundice (esp. with head of pancreas) → pale stools, dark urine, pruritis
            - Courvoisier sign: enlarged, non-tender gallbladder + painless jaundice = unlikely gallstones
                - Consider carcinoma (pancreas, cholangiocarcinoma)
        - Abdominal mass (e.g. hepatomegaly with metastases)

                - Vitamin ADEK, iron studies, B12, folate, CMP
        - Imaging
            - CT-CAP or PET (staging)
            - ERCP or MRCP (if CT unsure)
                - ERCP can lead to samples being taken for cytology or histology
                    - Symptomatic biliary obstruction can be alleviated with stenting
- Pancreatic cancer - interpret these results:
    
    Total bilirubin: ~300
    Conjugated bilirubin ~ 260
    ALT, GGT, ALP raised
    AST normal
    
    1. Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia → post-hepatic cause of jaundice
    2. Obstructive LFT pattern of disease (raised ALP, GGT)
    3. Elevated ALT (possibly due to biliary backflow or metastases)

    - CT displaying a mass within the pancreas
        - Ill-defined hypoattenuating lesion
    - Dilatation of the pancreatic duct OR common bile duct and parenchymal atrophy
    - Double duct sign
        - Dilation of pancreatic ducts and common bile duct
- Pancreatic cancer - decision to biopsy and considerations
    - Not required before surgical resection (should not delay appropriate surgery)
    - Required in patients with advanced unresectable disease selected for palliative therapy (to confirm prognosis and treatment options)
    - Options for biopsy
        - Endoscopic U/S guided biopsy or FNA to reduce risk of seeding
        - Pancreatic ductal brushings or biopsy during ERCP
    - Note: percutaneous FNA or biopsy is not preferred due to risk of peritoneal seeding
- Histopathological appearance of pancreatic cancer
    - Characteristic features
        - Highly invasive
        - Intense non-neoplastic host reaction → fibroblasts, lymphocytes, extracellular matrix
    - Macroscopic
        - Often hard, grey-white, stellate, poorly-defined mass with significant desmoplastic response
        - Most obstruct distal CBD as it courses through the head
    - Histology
        - Often moderate to poor differentiation of glandular tissue → forms abortive tubular structures or cell clusters
            - Exhibits aggressive and deeply infiltrative growth
            - Associated with dense stromal fibrosis which accompanies tumour invasion
        - Subtypes are defined based on distinctive histological patterns
            - Adenosquamous
            - Colloid
            - Hepatoid
            - Anaplastic (undifferentiated)
- Pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer
    - Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas probably arise from non-invasive precursor lesions (often pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs)) which display proliferation of ductal epithelium + dysplasia
        - Develop through progressive accumulation of telomere shortening
        - Characteristic mutations of oncogenes (e.g. KRAS) and tumour suppressor genes (e.g. CDKN2A/p16, p53, SMAD4)

- Pancreatic cancer - natural history and methods of spread. What treatments for localised disease?
    - Statistics
        - 5-year survival rate (8%)
        - Only 20% of patients are eligible for surgical resection at diagnosis
    - Localised disease
        - Head of pancreas → resection using Whipple’s (pancreaticoduodectomy)
        - Body and tail → rare to be limited due to early metastases
            - Local pancreatectomy +/- splenectomy
    - Invading surrounding structures
        - Spleen, duodenum, gut, stomach, liver
        - Has a striking tendency for perineural invasion
    - Lymphatic spread
        - Drains to pancreaticoduodenal nodes → pre-post pyloric lymph nodes → coeliac or superior mesenteric nodes → pre-aortic group → intestinal trunk and cisterna chyli
    - Haematogenous
        - **Liver**
        - Peritoneum > lungs > pleura > bones > adrenals
- What are the different types of pancreatic cancer?
    - Exocrine (90%)
        - Ductal adenocarcinoma (most common)
            - Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (precursor lesion to ductal adenocarcinoma) → proliferation of ductal epithelium
        - Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm
            - Intraductal expansion of mucin-producing ductal cells → produces highly viscous mucus
        - Other
            - Mucinous cystic neoplasm
                - Cystic mass with thick fibrous wall
                - 90% in body and tail
            - Acinar cell carcinoma
    - Endocrine (10%)
        - Neuroendocrine tumours (islet cells) → commonly produce paraneoplastic syndromes
            - Gastrinoma (secretes gastrin - Zollinger-Ellison syndrome)
            - Insulinoma → episodic hypoglycaemia
                - Whipple’s triad: low BSL, signs and symptoms, relief on glucose administration
            - Glucagonoma → diabetes, weight loss, neuropsychiatric syndroms
            - VIPoma → secretes VIP = watery diarrhoea, hypochlorhydria, hypokalaemia
- Why does pancreatic cancer have such a poor prognosis? Why is it worse than CRC?
    - Pancreatic cancer is often asymptomatic until late in the disease course
        - Hence, body and tail of pancreas carcinoma has a worse prognosis
    - Highly aggressive
    - Chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance
        - Partially due to the nature of the cancer as highly fibrotic and reduced drug penetrance
    - Note CRC has a screening test (iFOBT) and presents symptomatically more commonly → early detection and more effective surgery + chemotherapy

PanINs → pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia

Trousseaus = migratory thrombophlebitis 

elevated obstructive LFTs

KRAS mutation analysis test? maybe? 

NETs = pancreatuc neuroendocrine tumour → specific scans = dodotape PET scan (usually not FTG PET +ve)

neuroendocrine carcinoma

technicium lutate to kill tumour 

staging done via CT, maybe ERCP

sometime no need biopsy if imaging is dx confimatory 

Whippl’s → curative pancreatic head cancer operation → not done if body/tail 

head present earlier 

- choledocojejunostomy + gastrojejunostomy
