# Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma

**Case Protocol**

***Case:** A 48-year-old man presented to his GP with a 2-week history of
sore throat, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and 7 kg weight loss. He
had also noted drenching night sweats during the last week.
Examination revealed pharyngitis with white plaques on the soft
palate and tonsillar area, and swelling of the lymphoid tissues of the
oropharynx. Several lymph nodes of 1.5-2.0 cm diameter were readily
palpable in the submandibular region, while nodes of a similar size
were present in the left axilla and even larger nodes in the groin of up to 4 cm.*

    - Amphotericin B
        - Mechanism
            - Binds ergosterol (unique to fungi)
            - Forms membrane pores which allow leakage of electrolytes
        - Clinical use
            - Serious and systemic mycoses
                - Cryptococcal meningitis
                - Coccidiodes
                - Blastomyces
                - Candida
        - AEs
            - Fever and chills
            - Hypotension
            - Nephrotoxicity
                - Alters tubule permeability resulting in hypoK and hypoMg
            - Arrhythmias
        - **Note: nystatin has similar mechanism and used topically due to toxicity**
            - Oral or vaginal candidiasis
            - Diaper rash
    - Azoles
        - E.g. fluconzaole, posaconazole, ketoconazole
        - Mechanism
            - Inhibits fungal sterol (ergosterol) synthesis by inhibiting CYP450 which converts lanosterol ro ergosterol
        - Use
            - Local and less serious systemic infections
                - Candidal infections
    - Terbinafine
        - Mechanism
            - Inhibits fungal enzyme squalene epioxidase
        - Use
            - Dermatophytoses (e.g. onychomycosis)
        - AE
            - GI upset
            - Headache
            - Hepatotoxicity

Generalised lymphadenopathy (lymph node involvement in multiple sites)

- Infective
    - EBV, CMV, HIV, TB, toxoplasmosis
- Neoplastic
    - Primary (more likely)
    - Secondary (CLL, ALL, solid organ tumour metastases)
- Drug induced (hypersensitivity)
- Inflammatory/infiltrative
    - SLE, RA, Sjogren’s, sarcoidosis

Investigations

- FBC and film (assess bone marrow function)
- UEC
    - Note: tumour lysis syndrome can be seen in rapidly proliferative malignancies (autolysis - Burkitt’s)
- CRP, ESR, LDH
- Imaging for hidden nodal involvement (CXR, CT neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis)
- Exclude viral pathology (serology) - EBV, CMV, HIV
- Assess autoimmune disease (serology)
- Lymph node core biopsy (histopathology, immunophenotyping)
    - Consider karyotype/FISH and molecular studies if abnormal results
    - Bacterial culture and sensitivity, fungal culture and sensitivity, TB testing if needed
- After diagnosis, staging (FDG PET +/- BMAT)

Interpretation

- Mild normocytic anaemia, mild thrombocytopaenia, mild neutropenia
    - ? marrow infiltration or acute illness
- High LDH (high tumour burden), hyperkalaemia, hypercalcaemia, hyperuricaemia
    - HyperK = arrhythmias and death
    - Tumour lysis syndrome = renal failure and death
        - Hyper K, Hyper PO4 (> 2 precipitates hypoCa), Hyper uric acid (intracellular ions which are released)
            - HypoCa (due to PO4 binding)
            - High uric acid causes renal failure
        - Manage with fluid resuscitation (aggressive hydration) and dialysis if needed
            - Can give allopurinol (reduce uric acid production) or rasburicase (make uric acid soluble)
    - HyperCa = neurological impairment, cardiac arrhythmias
    
    Note: membrane stabilisation (Ca gluconate, resonium (K binder), insulin and dextrose (promote intracellular K movement)
    
    NHL - myc-BCL2 is double hit lymphoma
    
    - Morphology, immunophenotyping, FISH needed for diagnosis +/- molecular studies
    - Aggressive lymphoma with aggressive treatment
    
    Risk factors
    
    - Often none
    - Immunodeficient states, autoimmune conditions (sjogren, coeliac)
    
    Prognosis
    
    - Hodgkin relies on subtype, staging and other markers
        - German (GHSH) score: stage, nodal sites, elevated ESR, age > 50, bulk and extranodal disease
    - NHL prognosis relies on detailed subtyping + staging + other biochemical and clinical indices
        - Prognostic scores exist for each major lymphoma subtype
            - E.g. DLBCL IPI
            - Stage, age > 60,
            - ECOG (functional status)
                - 0 = independent, unrestricted function
                - 1-3: limitations to function
                - 4 = bed bound
                - 5 = dead
            - Elevated LDH, > 1
            - Extranodal sites (Ann Arbor staging)
    
    Oral candidiasis 
    
    - Can lead to lymphoma related immunoparesis or underlying undiagnosed immunodeficiency (e.g. HIV AIDS)
        - Excess malignant B cells impedes normal B cell function (including poor plasma cell function - low antibodies)
    - Treatment: nilstatin 1g QID for 10 days
