# Pyrexia (fever) of unknown origin (PUO/FUO)

*A 45-year-old female schoolteacher presents to ED with a 3-week history of fever, especially in the afternoon and evening, associated with night sweats. Her appetite was poor, but she denied weight loss and has had mild abdominal discomfort. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.5°C, a regular HR of 88, and a BP of 130/80, and mild diffuse abdominal tenderness. Examination was otherwise unremarkable.*

- Pathogenesis of fever
    - Caused by an increase in the thermoregulatory set-point of the hypothalamus
        - Exogenous triggers
            - Directly stimulate the hypothalamus (e.g. LPS on gram negative organism)
        - Endogenous triggers
            - IL1, IL6, TNFa → released in circulation in response to infection, trauma, systemic disease
                - Act on hypothalamus through local production of PGE2 → increase thermal set point
    - Results in increased body temperature due to:
        - Increased heat production
            - Increased basal metabolic rate
            - Shivering thermogenesis
        - Peripheral heat conservation
            - Vasoconstriction at skin
            - Piloerection
    - Hence, fever causes rigors, night sweats, chils, peripheral vasodilation/vasoconstriction
        - Exaggerated diurnal variation (warmest in late afternoon, coolest in early morning)
            - Sweating at night to lower body temperature
            - Can take up to a week for normal variation to resume
- Management of FUO
    - Supportive care
        - Fluid and electrolyte replacement
        - Analgesia
    - Consider draining abscess if present
    - Empirical antibiotic cover
        - Gentamicin (4-5mg/kg IV daily) for Gram negative (< 48h duration) **SEE GUIDELINES (currently first line** but might change in new guidelines**)**
        - Amoxy/Ampicilin 2g IV Q6H
        - Metronidazole 500mg IV Q12h for anaerobes
        - periods are defo a mood - how are you feeling tho esp with your iron status
        - Consider
            - Ceftriaxone 2g IV for N. meningitidis
            - Meropenem for MDR Gram negatives
        - **If duration of treatment ≥ 72h, switch gentamicin for piperacillin + tazobactam**
    - If Px allergic to penicillins
        - **Non-immediate**/non-anaphylactic
            - Ceftriaxone (1g IV daily)/Cefotaxime (1g IV Q8h) + Metronidazole
            - Cephalosporin for Gram +ve cover
        - **Immediate** allergy/Severe anaphylactic
            - Clindamycin (600mg IV Q8h) + Gentamicin (5mg/kg IV daily)
- What SEs would you see w/ gentamicin, amoxicillin, metronidazole tx
    - Gentamicin
        - Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity (w/ prolonged tx)
    - Metronidazole
        - Peripheral neuropathy
        - Disulfiram-like reaction with alcohol (nausea and vomiting)
    - C. difficile colitis (esp. piptaz)
    - Thrombophlebitis
- What precautions should the doctor take when the px’s temp is measured?
    - Infection control: Mask, hand hygiene, PPE
    - Logistics: Make sure to check if patient has NOT had something hot or cold → if oral thermometer
- The U/S revealed a mass associated with the large bowel in the left iliac fossa. An abdo CT scan characterised the mass and suggested it was an abscess. What is the likely predisposing factor for development of the abscess?
    - Contributing factors
        - Abdominal abscesses may be related to diverticulosis (in this px)
            - False diverticula of colonic mucosa where faeces can impact → inflammation → abscess formation
        - Penetrating injury and introduction of skin flora
        - Perforation of bowel → peritonitis, abdominal abscesses
        - Liver abscesses from haematogenous dissemination of gut bacteria via portal vein
- Based on this finding what would you do next
    - Drain the abscess (radiological or surgical) for source control and diagnostic purposes
        - Perform FNAB under CT or US guidance
        - Send aspirate for MCS
- (random) RFs
    
    Appendicitis 
    
    Diverticulitis
    
    Bariatric surgery
    
- What bact. commonly a/w intraabdo abscesses?
    
    81.9% cases are polymicrobial 
    
    - Gram +ve facultative anaerobes (Enterococci)
        - Enterococcus faecalis
        - Enterococcus faecium
    - Gram -ve
        
        Most common anaerobes: Bacteroides fragilis 
        
        Most common facultative anaerobes: E. coli
        
        - Klebsiella spp.
    - Skin organisms **(rare)**
        - Staph. saprophyticus
        - S. aureus
        - S. pyogenes
