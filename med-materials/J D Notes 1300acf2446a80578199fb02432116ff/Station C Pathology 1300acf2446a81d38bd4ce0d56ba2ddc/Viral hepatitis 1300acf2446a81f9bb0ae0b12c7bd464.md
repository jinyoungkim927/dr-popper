    - Increased AST and ALT
        - Reflects hepatocellular damage (ALT > AST suggests viral)
            - HAV (rapid rise and fall)
            - HBV (gradual)
    - Elevated bilirubin
        - Partly due to obstruction of bile canaliculi by hepatocellular swelling and surrounding oedema
            - May be due to hepatocellular damage
        - Seen mainly in HAV and HBV
    - Elevated ALP and GGT
        - Released by cells lining the bile canaliculi
            - Mark obstruction and may indicate mild obstruction from hepatocellular swelling and oedema
    - Normal albumin, globulin and total protein
        - Suggest acute process
- AST and ALT ratios
    - ALT is more specific for liver damage than AST
    - AST:ALT > 2:1 suggests alcoholic liver disease
        - Especially in context of elevated GGT and normal ALP
    - Magnitude of AST and ALT elevations can also indicate the underlying aetiology
        - Ischaemic
            - ≥ 50x ULN with elevated lactate
        - Acute viral or toxin related
            - AST and ALT > 10-25x ULN
        - Alcoholic
            - AST < 8x ULN and ALT < 5x ULN
        - NASH
            - AST and ALT < 4x ULN
        - Chronic (variable)
    - What is the R value
        - Can help determine the likely type of liver injury (hepatocellular v cholestatic)
        - R value = **(ALT/ULN ALT)** / **(ALP/ULN ALP)**
            - More than 5 = hepatocellular
            - 2-5 = mixed pattern
            - Less than 2 = cholestatic
- Why is there bilirubin in the urine? What is the normal metabolic pathway for bilirubin?
    - Bilirubinuria indicates that unconjugated bilirubin (water insoluble) has been made water soluble through conjugation to glucuronate
        - Occurs in hepatocellular and post-hepatic jaundice
    - Normal bilirubin metabolism
        - Haem → biliverdin (via haem oxygenase-1) → unconjugated bilirubin (via biliverdin reductase)
            - Conjugated by UDP-glucuronosyl transferase → soluble biliubin
        - Excreted by liver cells into bile canaliculus → intestine
            - Intestinal flora degrade conjugated bilirubin into urobilinogen
                - In stool (stercobilin pigment) produced from urobilinogen converted to stercobilinogen
                - Remainder of urobilinogen reabsorbed into liver
                    - Some excreted in urine as urobilin (yellow pigment)

- How does the immune response to HBV produce its characteristic features
    - HBV is not lethal to the hepatocytes which it is found
        - Liver damage seen with HBV infection is purely due to cell-mediated immune attack on the infected hepatocytes
    - CD8+ T cells target HBsAg and cause lysis of infected cells which express HBsAg on their cell membranes
        - With failure of T cell recognitiokn of HBsAg, these antigens continue to be expressed and liver damage continues through T cell attack against nucleocapsid antigens (HBcAg and HBeAg)
            - Results in chronic disease state
    - When antibodies develop to HBeAg → the virus loses the ability to replicate
- Macroscopic and microscopic pathological changes in viral hepatitis
    - Macroscopic
        - Liver may show acute yellow atrophy
            - Shrunken and patchy yellow in appearance
    - Microscopic
        - Panlobular infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils
        - Hepatocyte injury and necrosis
            - Ballooning degeneration (diffuse swelling, large cytoplasm)
            - Ground glass hepatocytes (accumulation of HBsAg in cytoplasm)
        - Kupffer cell (macrophage) hyperplasia
        - Cholestasis
- Complications of viral hepatitis (inc. extra hepatic complications from HBV or HCV)
    - Acute
        - Fulminant hepatitis with widespread hepatocellular necrosis
            - Hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral oedema
            - Coagulation derangement (platelet dysfunction)
            - Ascites
            - AKI (hepatorenal syndrome)
            - Metabolic derangements
        - Extra-hepatic complications of HBV and HCV infection
            - Vasculitis
            - Renal (GN)

    - Chronic
        - Persistent constitutional Sx (fatigue, anorexia, myalgia)
        - Asymptomatic carrier state
        - **HCC**
            - Risk highest in HCV and HBV
        - **Liver failure and cirrhosis**
            - Impaired toxin, drug and hormone metabolism
                - Hyperammonaemia
                - Hyperbilirubinaemia
                - Hyperoestrogenaemia

- What is hepatic encephalopathy
    - Signs
        - Altered LoC (range from confusion to coma)
        - Disorientation and memory impairment
        - Impaired sleeping patterns
        - Psychiatric disturbances
        - Motor signs (tremor, muscle rigidity)
        - Asterixis
            - ”Flapping tremor” due to rhythmic lapses of postural muscle tone with rapid jerking of limbs
    - Pathophysiology
        - Massive insult to the liver resulting in accumulation of nitrogenous waste products in the CNS
            - Loss of liver function = unable to metabolise and detoxify nitrogenous compounds (e.g. NH3)
        - Nitrogenous compounds metabolised to glutamine by astrocytes
            - This accumulates in the cytoplasm of glial cells and causes swelling secondary to osmotic flow of water from vasculature to the cells
            - Hence, cerebral oedema → raised ICP → neurological deterioration
    - Treatment
        - Rifaximin
            - Broad-spectrum antibiotic which cannot be absorbed by the gut
            - Results in decreased NH3 production by intestinal bacteria
        - Lactulose
            - Converted to lactic acid by intestinal fora
                - Acidification of the gut causes conversion of ammonia to ammonium → faecally excreted
- How does cirrhosis and HCC develop
    - Chronic infection → persistent concurrent inflammation and healing (fibrosis, risk of acquired cellular dysplasia) → cirrhosis and HCC
    - Note: HBV DNA may integrate into host DNA and result in chromosomal instability → increased HCC risk
- Management of viral hepatitis
    - General
        - Lifestyle changes (e.g. weight loss and cessation of alcohol consumption)
            - Promote healing in the liver and minimise insults
        - Medication review for hepatotoxic substances
        - Supportive care is the mainstay for acute infection (fluid and electrolytes, analgesia)
        - If fulminant hepatitis → supportive + consider liver transplantation
    - HBV
        - Acute: supportive care
        - Prophylaxis: vaccination or passive HBV immunoglobulin
        - Goals for chronic infection management
            - Long-term suppression of viral replication (undetectable HBV DNA in serum)
                - Reduces inflammation and progression to cirrhosis and HCC
            - Requires regular monitoring
                - 3-6 monthly HBV DNA
                - Serology to assess viral response and adherence
        - Pegylated interferon-a
            - Mechanism
                - Long-acting interferon which binds to specific cell-surface receptors
                    - Increases transcription and translation of genes → increased immune proteins which interfere with HBV activity and replication
            - Treatment duration: 48 weeks
                - No risk of resistance
                - Weekly SC injection
        - Long-term nucleoside or nucleotide analogues **(reverse transcriptase inhibitors)**
            - E.g. entecavir → guanasine analogue; tenofovir → adenosine analogue)
            - Mechanism
                - Acts as alternative substrates for viral DNA polymerase and results in DNA chain termination → prevents viral DNA synthesis
    - HCV
        - All patients with sustained detectable HCV should be considered for treatment
        - Pangenotypic regimens act as inhibitors of non-structural viral proteins
            - NS5B nucleotide inhibitors (e.g. sofosbuvir)
            - NS5A inhibitors (e.g. velpatasvir)
            - NS3/4A protease inhibitors (e.g. glecaprevir
        - Can be given in combination regimens
            - Duration is often for 8-12 weeks
        - Monitoring after treatment to ensure sustained virological response
            - HCV RNA PCR undetectable at least 12 weeks after completing direct-acting antiviral therapy
            - Monitor LFTs
        - Important to treat HIV as coinfection if high
            - Untreated, it may accelerate progression of HCV-induced liver fibrosis

- Hepatopulmonary syndrome
    - Characterised by a triad of abnormal PaO2 caused by intrapulmonary vascular dilatations in the setting of liver disease OR portal HTN
    - Pathogenesis
        - Unclear but proposed that bacterial translocation and toxin release from portal HTN may stimulate release of vasoactive mediators (e.g. NO)
        - Results in pulmonary vasodilation or angiogenesis
    - Pathophysiology
        - Pulmonary capillary dilation results in V/Q mismatch
        - Anatomic shunts between pulmonary arterial and venous capillary beds
- Public health considerations for viral hepatitis
    - Acute viral hepatitis is a notifiable disease
        - Contact local district PHUs
        - Contact tracing
    - Hepatitis A
        - Case should not attend school or childcare (avoid contact with others, food preparation)
            - Often 6 weeks absence
        - Close contracts notified and receive post-exposure prophylaxis ASAP (within 2 weeks of contact)
            - Monovalent inactivated HAV vaccine
            - Normal human Ig
    - Hepatitis B
        - Identify contacts (sexual partners, newborn child of case, household members)
        - Post-exposure prophylaxis
            - Passive Ig with HBV Ig
            - Vaccination if needed

### Past question: viral hepatitis (diagnostics)

**Case:**

*A 35-year-old homosexual male presents with **right upper quadrant** pain with 2 week history of nausea, **vomiting, diarrhoea**. In his early 20s, he has a history of **IVDU** but has since claimed to stop. While overseas in South Africa, he got a few tattoos on his arms and legs. On examination, he has hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice with some protein in the urine (GN).*

- PDx
    - Patient has risk factors for viral hepatitis
        - IVDU and tattoos (HCV, HBV)
        - Recent travel to Africa (endemic HAV or HEV)
    - Given clinical signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis (RUQ, vomiting or diarrhoea)
        - Suggests HAV → more likely to be symptomatic and more severe clinical course
- Histopathology of HAV
    - Swelling of hepatocytes
    - Bridging necrosis (spans adjacent lobules)
    - Councilman bodies
        - Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei → remnants of apoptotic hepatocytes
        - Apoptosis of virus-infected cells induced by release of granzyme B and perforin from CD8 T cells
- Phases of viral hepatitis
    - Inoculation
        - Virus enters blood stream via direct contact (e.g. HBV, HCV, HDV) or across intestine (HAV, HEV)
    - Incubation phase
        - Virus multiples but the patient is asymptomatic
            - HAV and HEV = 15-60 days
            - HBV, HCV, HDV = 40-180 days
    - **Acute infection: pre-icteric phase**
        - Caused by inflammatory response to virus as CD8 T cells activate and kill infected hepatocytes
        - Non-specific
            - Nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea
            - Anorexia, malaise
            - Fever, RUQ pain
        - Serum-sickness like syndrome in some HBV patients
            - Fever, rash and angioedema
    - **Acute infection: icteric phase**
        - After 3-10 days
            - **Jaundice** → dark urine and pale stools
            - **Systemic symptoms fade and patient improves clinically**
        - Hepatomegaly and tender liver edge + splenomegaly in some people
    - Recovery phase
        - Over 2-4 weeks → jaundice fades
    - **If they do not recover**
        - Healthy carrier
            - Individuals carry virus but do not suffer recurrent bouts of replication with inflammation
        - Persistent chronic infection
            - People who carry virus (circulation RNA or DNA persists) and suffer recurrent bouts of viral replication and inflammation
                - HBV and HCV more likely to be chronic → risk of HCC
- Causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
    - Increased bilirubin production
        - Increased extravascular haemolysis (via reticuloendothelial system)
            - Thalassaemia, hereditary spherocytosis
            - G6PD deficiency
        - Increased intravascular haemolysis
            - Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
            - MAHA
            - Infections (e.g,. malaria)
    - Impaired hepatic bilirubin uptake
        - Decreased liver perfusion (e.g. liver failure, sepsis)
    - Impaired hepatic bilirubin conjugation
        - Inherited
            - Gilbert syndrome (AD)
            - Crigler-Najaar syndrome (AR)
        - Acquired
            - Liver failure or cirrhosis
    - Note: can cross BBB and cause kernicterus
        - Kernicterus = chronic bilirubin encephalopathy due to deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in the basal ganglia or brainstem nuclei
            - Paresis and movement disorders
            - Vertical gaze palsy
            - Hearing impairment
- Causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
    - Causes of acute hepatic injury
    - Defect of canalicular or sinusoidal transport and reuptake
        - Dubin-Johnson syndrome
            - Impaired excretion of bile from hepatocytes into bile canaliculi
        - Rotor syndrome
    - Biliary pathology
        - Intraluminal (e.g gallstones)
        - Intramural (e.g. atresia, strictures, cholangiocarcinoma)
        - Extramural (e.g. pancreatitis, malignancy)
