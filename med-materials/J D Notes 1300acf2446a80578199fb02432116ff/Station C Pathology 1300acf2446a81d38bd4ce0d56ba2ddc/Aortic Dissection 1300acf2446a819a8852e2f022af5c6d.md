        Stanford A  
        
        Anything w/ ascending aorta involved; proximal to brachiocephalic (regardless of origin)
        
        Typically requires surgery 
        
        Complications = aortic regurg, cardiac tamponade 
        
        Stanford B 
        
        No ascending aorta involved; origin distal to L subclavian  
        
        HTN management: B-Blockers, vasodilators

- Ix approach to aortic dissection
    - Pre-Ix
        - Concurrent assessment + resuscitation PRN w/ A-E approach
        - Evaluate need for urgent surgical intervention and call for senior help
        - Analgesia
    - **Diagnostic Ix (radiological + high index of suspicion)**
        - CXR
            - Widened mediastinum +/-  aortic ‚Äúknuckle‚Äù distortion; tracheal deviation
            - Important to rule out potentially life-threatening DDx (e.g. tension pneumothorax)
        - Gold standard is combination of:
            - CT angiography (stable patients)
                - Demonstrate a dilated aorta and presence of a false lumen (separated by intimal flap)
            - TOE (unstable patients - ICU or OT)
                - Important to elicit evidence of aortic regurgitation and/or pericardial extension
            - Consider CT CAP to assess the extent of extension
    - Ancillary investigations
        - Bedside
            - ECG ‚Üí DDx ACS
            - UA (given AKI)
        - Bloods
            - FBC (anaemia, WCC in carditis or pneumonia) + CRP/ESR
            - UEC, LFTs, serum lactate (end organ damage)
            - Serial troponins (rule out coronary artery malperfusion as a complication)

- Relationship b/w Marfan‚Äôs and aortic dissection
    - Marfan‚Äôs syndrome is an AD connective tissue disorder caused by a defect in the fibrillin gene (FBN1)
        - Codes for fibrillin-1a glycoprotein component in the ECM which is particularly abundant in aorta and ligaments
        - Defective fibrillin ‚Üí defective elastin and weak CT
            - Aorta is more vulnerable to stress resulting in aortic root dilatation and dissection
- Complications of aortic dissection
    - Cardiac
        - Aortic regurgitation ‚Üí cardiogenic shock or heart failure
        - Cardiac tamponade ‚Üí obstructive shock
        - MI due to reduced CO or obstruction of coronary artery ostia
    - Ischaemic complications
        - Aortic rupture ‚Üí hypovolaemic shock
        - Obstruction of aortic branches by haematoma (end organ damage)
            - Stroke (carotid) or spinal arteries
            - Renal arteries
            - GIT
- Pathology specimen

    - Macroscopic pathological specimen of the heart (left ventricle divided and reflected) and the proximal ascending aorta (divided and reflect open)
        - There appears to be a thrombus which has formed with a false lumen between the intima and media
        - An approximate 2cm dissecting tear can be seen approximately 2cm above the aortic valve
    - Other changes
        - LV appears slightly hypertrophied (possibly due to long-standing HTN)
- Explain murmur and renal abnormalities in dissection
    - Diastolic murmur
        - Proximal dissection extends into aortic valve apparatus and results in aortic incompetence
            - 50-65% of ascending dissections (audible in 30%)
        - Multiple mechanisms
            - Dilation of aortic root and valve annulus (prevents leaflets opposing)
            - Pressure of false aneurysm on one side = asymmetrical
            - Annular support disruption due to failure of valve leaflet
            - Prolapse of intimal flap through aortic valve
    - Renal dysfunction
        - Distal dissection can occlude side branches (e.g. renal artery ‚Üí ischaemia +/- infarction ‚Üí pre-renal AKI)
        - Patient may have underlying renal disease due to HTN
- Management of aortic dissection
    - Initial management
        - Primary survey + resuscitation
        - Analgesia
    - Definitive
        - Stanford A ‚Üí immediate surgical correction (suture affected aortic layers + graft reinforcement)
        - Stanford B
            - Blood pressure management
            - Sedation
            - Surgical or endovascular correction

- What causes the collapsing pulse
    - Collapsing pulse is commonly associated with aortic regurgitation
        - Rapid upstroke due to increased stroke volume filling arteries
            - Secondary to increased EDV due to retrograde blood flow from aortic into LV during regurgitation (in diastole)
        - Rapid downstroke has two causes
            - Sudden fall in diastolic pressure in aorta due to regurgitation into LV
            - Rapid emptying of arterial system
