    - DDx for a neck lump
        - Cyst
        - Lipoma
        - Lymphadenopathy
            - Reactive, malignancy

            - Infectious, malignancy
        - Thyroid pathology
            - Neoplasia (adenoma, carcinoma)
            - Multinodular goitre
            - Endocrine (Graves, Hashimoto’s)

- Investigative approach to thyroid cancer
    - Definitive diagnostic investigations
        - TSH
            - Higher TSH suggests malignancy (due to loss of function of thyroid)
        - Thyroid US and FNAB [for known or suspected nodules]
            - US
                - Confirm nodularity
                - Suspicious features of sonography

                    - Irregular margins
            - Gold standard (obtains cytological Dx)
        - Note: evaluation depends on TSH level
            - TSH low suggests hyperthyroidism
                - Thyroid scan (radionuclide iodine - Tc99m or I-123)

    - Wound seroma or **haematoma**
        - Note: haematoma can be fatal due to airway occlusion
    - **Hypocalcaemia (removal of parathyroid glands)**
    - **Hoarseness**
        - **Transient → vocal cord oedema from intubation (common)**
        - Persistent is rare (vocal cord palsy due to nerve injury to arytenoid dislocation)

        - Loss of supply to cricothyroid → affects tenor voice
    - Tracheal or oesophageal injury
        - Dysphagia
    - Horner’s syndrome (transection of ipsilateral SNS fibres)

                - May have pseudoinclusions due to invagination of cytoplasm
            - **Psammoma bodies**
                - Small laminated spherical bodies with dystrophic calcification

            - Compressive symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, dysphagia)
        - Older patients
            - Very poor prognosis (mortality almost 100%)
            - **Associated with TP53 mutation and other oncogenes (RAS)**
            - Often associated with a PMHx of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma
        - Histology
            - Bulky masses which grow beyond thyroid capsule into adjacent neck structures
            - Patterns of histology

                - Spindle cells with sarcomatous appearance
                - Mixed spindle or giant cell lesions
- What is lymphatic drainage?
    - Lymph drainage runs in the interlobular connective tissue, often near the arteries
        - Pass initially to pre-laryngeal, pre-tracheal and para-tracheal lymph nodes
    - **Pre-laryngeal drain to upper deep cervical nodes**
    - **Pre-tracheal and para-tracheal to lower deep cervical nodes**
    - Some may drain directly into brachiocephalic lymph modes or thoracic duct
- How do metastases occur?
    - Local invasion
        - Extra-thyroid extension to trachea, oesophagus
        - Anaplastic carcinoma tends to grow rapidly and can compromise vital structures
    - Lymphatic spread **[papillary more common]**
        - Cervical lymph nodes (prelaryngeal, pretracheal, paratracheal)
            - Deep cervical chain
    - Haematogenous spread **[follicular more common]**
        - **Lung**, liver, bone
- What is the relation of the vessels to the nerve?
    - Right recurrent laryngeal nerve is close to anterior or posterior branches of the inferior thyroid artery at the inferior pole of the thyroid gland
    - Left RLN is less likely to be injured as it has a more vertical ascent from the superior mediastinum
        - Still in close proximity at the inferior pole

            - Ascend in the tracheo-oesophageal groove
            - Enters larynx posterior to cricothyroid joint through fibres of inferior pharyngeal constrictor
                - Becomes inferior laryngeal nerve at this point
