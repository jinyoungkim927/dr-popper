                - Peri-appendiceal fat stranding
            - CXR → investigate pneumoperitoneum
- Pathogenesis of appendicitis
    1. Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen (most common cause)
        1. Causes: lymphoid tissue hyperplasia (children, young adults), appendiceal faecolith and stasis (adults), neoplasm (uncommon), parasitic infection (uncommon)
    2. Ongoing mucosal secretions = increased intraluminal pressure and distension
    3. Impairment of venous and lymphatic outflow → swelling and oedema
    4. Compression of appendiceal blood vessels → ischaemia and necrosis
        1. Note: appendicular artery is an end-artery which is vulnerable to oedema or thrombosis from inflammation
    5. Loss of epithelial integrity (inflammation) → bacterial translocation and suppurative inflammmation
    6. Fibrinoexudative reaction on serosal surface → irritation of parietal peritoneum
- Complications of appendicitis
    - Acute
        - Gangrenous appendicitis (infarction)
        - Perforation → generalised peritonitis, ileus, septic shock
    - Subacute
        - Abscess (appendiceal or periappendicular)
            - Drainage may protect against fistulation
                - 4cm is a guide (smaller = antibiotics, larger = drainage)
        - Phlegmon formation
    - Chronic
        - Adhesion formation (secondary to peritonitis or surgery
            - Further risk of SBO
    - General surgical and anaesthetic risks for treatment
- Management of appendicitis
    - Initial management
        - Concurrent assessment and resuscitation as needed guided by primary survey (A-E approach)
        - Supportive therapy
            - Bowel rest → NBM
            - Commence IV fluid and electrolyte maintenance
            - Analgesia
    - Definitive management
        - Empirical antibiotics (awaiting surgery)
            - Note: simple, non-complicated appendicitis may be treated with 1-3 days of IV antibiotics until clinical improvement with an oral course for a total of 7-10 days
            - Ampicillin, gentamicin, metronidazole
                - If gentamicin contraindicated → ceftriaxone
                - If penicillin hypersensitivity → clindamycin
            - If acute, non-perforated appendicitis - cease antibiotics after surgery
            - If acute, perforated appendicitis
                - Total 5 days (IV + oral) antibiotics post appendicectomy
        - Surgical appendicectomy
            - +/- Surgical drainage of abscess may be indicated
            - +/- Ileocaecal resection may be indicated for phlegmon
- Appendiceal positions and impact on clinical presentation
    - Most important positions
        - Retro-caecal or retrocolic (75%)
            - Flank or back pain (high appendix below R costal margin)
            - Psoas sign
            - May have rigidity
        - Pelvic (20%)
            - Suprapubic or pelvic pain
            - Urinary and bowel symptoms (frequency, dysuria, diarrhoea, tenesmus)
            - Obturator sign
        - Pre-ileal or post-ileal (5%)
            - Vomiting and diarrhoea (irritation of distal ileum)
- Vascular supply of appendix
    - Arterial
        - Appendicular artery from SMA
    - Venous
        - Appendicular vein → SMV → portal vein
    - Vascular supply contained within mesoappendix
- Lymphatic drainage of appendix
    - Appendicular lymph nodes (within mesoappendix) → ileocolic lymph nodes → superior mesenteric nodes → intestinal lymph trunk → cisterna chyli
- Innervation of appendix
    - Ileocolic branch of superior mesenteric plexus
        - PSNS: vagus nerve
        - SNS: lesser splanchnic nerve (T10-T11)
    - Afferent sensory fibres via SNS fibres to enter the spinal cord at T10-T11 dermatome level
- Explain migratory pain and involved dermatomes in appendicitis
    - Initial pain in acute appendicitis is visceral
        - Activation of visceral afferent fibres which travel with the sympathetic supply to the appendix
            - Fibres → superior mesenteric plexus → lesser splanchnic nerve → dorsal root ganglia of T10-T11
            - Interpretation of pain signals is one that originates from the T10-11 dermatome (periumbilical region)
    - Delayed somatic pain once inflammation spreads to the serosa and irritates the parietal peritoneum
        - Pain migrates to the RLQ and becomes sharply localised
            - Somatic nerve fibres originate from the dorsal root ganglia of T12-L1
            - Carried by right subcostal nerve and/or L1 lumbar nerve
    - Note: midline visceral pain as the visceral organs are supplied with bilateral afferents (embryonic midline structure)
        - Lateralises with somatic pain which has better somatotopic mapping
- Macroscopic and microscopic features
    - Macroscopic
        - Large, distended appendix (due to oedema)
        - Serosal surface demonstrates signs of acute inflammation
            - Erythema with congested blood vessels and fibrinosuppurative exudation
        - Internal surface
            - Thickened and oedematous wall
            - Distended lumen with purulent fluid
            - Hyperaemic mucosa
    - Microscopic
        - Transmural inflammation with the hallmarks of acute inflammation
            - Vascular dilation and congestion, oedema, infiltration of inflammatory cells (neutrophils predominant)
            - Lymphoid hyperplasia (likely reactive)

- What is a faecolith + significance
    - A stony mass of compacted faeces which occur in severe cases of stool stasis with faecal impaction
        - Form around a nidus in layers
        - May contain calcification visible on radiographs
    - Can precipitate appendicitis or diverticulitis when obstructing the lumen
