# Cervical spine fracture and spinal cord injury (Anat)

**Case:** *A 22-year-old surfer dumped into the sand, sustained a neck injury that is likely a cervical spine fracture at the level of C6.*

- How would you protect the neck?
    - Collar for in-line fixation
        - Can use 2 x saline bags + tape
    - Rigid spine board
    - Log roll when moving the patient
    - If airway manoeuvres are necessary, only jaw thrust and no head tilt
- Rules to guide imaging in C-spine injuries? How do you clear a C-spine injury without imaging
    
    **NEXUS criteria (NSAID)**
    
    - Neurological deficit
    - Spinal tenderness (midline)
    - Altered mental status or LOC
    - Intoxication
    - Distracting injury

- Rule for nerve involvement in lumbar disc herniation or C-spine injury
    - The nerve root affected is numbered one inferior to the herniated disc or injury
    - Lumbar
        - L4/L5 disc herniation = L5 nerve root injury
        - In thoracic and lumbar regions, the intervertebral disc forms the inferior half of the anterior border of the intervertebral foramen
            - Superior half formed by bone of the body of the superior vertebra
            - The nerve which exits a given intervertebral foramen passes through the superior bony half of the foramen and hence, lies above and is not affected by a herniating disc at that level
                - However, nerve roots passing to the IV foramen immediately and farther below pass directly across the area of herniation
    - Cervical
        - Intervertebral discs are centrally placed in the anterior border of the intervertebral foramen and a herniated disc would compress the nerve exiting at that level
            - However, cervical nerves exit superior to the vertebra of the same number
            - Hence, C5-C6 herniation compression affects C6

- Spinal arteries
    - Arterial supply to the spinal cord comes from two sources
    - Longitudinally oriented vessels
        - Single anterior spinal artery
            - Origin: vertebral arteries (union of two vessels)
            - Passes inferiorly approximately parallel to the anterior median fissure
        - Two posterior spinal arteries
            - Origin: usually from a terminal branch of each vertebral artery (e.g. PICA)
            - Descend along the spinal cord as two branches
                - Bracket the posterolateral sulcus and connection of posterior roots with the spinal cord
        - **Reinforced along their length by 8-10 segmental medullary arteries**
            - The largest is the arteria radicularis magna **(artery of Adamkiewicz)**
                - Arises in the lower thoracic or upper lumbar region (usually on left) to reinforce the arterial supply to the lower spinal cord (including lumbosacral enlargement)
        
        ![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 11.04.15 am.png](Cervical%20spine%20fracture%20and%20spinal%20cord%20injury%20(An%201300acf2446a819290a4d79f1b29cd11/Screenshot_2023-04-10_at_11.04.15_am.png)
        
    - Segmental spinal arteries
        - Feeder arteries which enter the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramina at every level
            - Arise predominantly from:
                - Vertebral and deep cervical arteries in neck
                - Posterior intercostal arteries in thorax
                - Lumbar arteries in abdomen
        - After entering a foramen, the segmental spinal arteries divide into anterior and posterior radicular arteries
            - Follow and supply the anterior and posterior roots
        - May also give off segmental medullary arteries (longitudinal) at various vertebral levels
