# Haemorrhagic Stroke (Anat, Path)

## Case Protocol 40 – **Subarachnoid (aneurysm) Haemorrhage**

**Case:**

*A 47-year-old woman was hurrying for a bus when she experienced a sudden violent headache and collapsed. She was assisted by a friend, who noted that the patient was conscious but confused and in pain.*

*Examination in the Emergency Department revealed a thin female, disoriented in time and place, with prominent nuchal rigidity. The remainder of the examination was normal apart from a sub-hyaloid haemorrhage in the right optic fundus.*

***Past Question:***

*A 56yo man with a background of HTN and smoking presents with severe headache occurring suddenly after a heated argument with his wife. He now experiences photophobia and there is nuchal rigidity.*

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: subarachnoid haemorrhage - likely due to rupture of a Berry aneurysm
        - Meningism triad (nuchal rigidity, photophobia, headache) → consistent with SAH
        - Hypertension and acute elevation of BP (argument) → rupture of aneurysm
    - DDx for meningism
        - Vascular
            - Intracranial haemorrhage
            - Ischaemic stroke
            - Cerebral venous thrombosis
        - Infective
            - Meningitis (bacterial, viral, other), encephalitis, cerebral abscess
        - Acute hypertensive crisis
        - Neoplastic - brain tumours (e.g. pituitary + haemorrhage/apoplexy)
- Subarachnoid haemorrhage - typical features
    - Sudden, severe ‘thunderclap’ headache → often occipital or holocephalic which may radiate to the neck
        - Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is the most common mimic
    - Meningism → headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, nuchal rigidity (suggests meningeal irritation)
        - Neck stiffness → palpable resistance with passive neck flexion
        - Brudzinski’s sign (tests aim to stretch the meninges and cause irritation → used more often in paediatrics)
            - Passively flex the patient’s neck and watch for flexion of the hips and knees
        - Kernig’s sign (tests aim to stretch the meninges and cause irritation → used more often in paediatrics)
            - With the patient supine, and hips and knee flexed to 90 degrees, attempt leg extension
            - If patient resists, experiences pain or cannot extend the knee beyond 135 degrees due to hamstring stiffness → test is positive
    - Raised ICP
        - Altered or decreased LoC → compression of reticular formation, herniation
        - Pupillary dilation → compression of CnIII interrupts PSNS supply to sphincter pupillae
        - Cushing’s triad (wide pulse pressure, bradycardia, irregular respirations)
            - Late sign suggesting herniation
        - Subacute or chronic signs
            - Headache which is worse in the morning or with bending over
            - Papilloedema
    - Terson’s syndrome
        - Intraocular haemorrhage secondary to intracranial bleeding
        - ‘Sub-hyaloid’ refers to the area between the vitreous chamber and retina (hyaloid is the membrane around the vitreous chamber)
- Causes of SAH
    - Traumatic (most common, identified on history, not a stroke)
    - Non-traumatic
        - Aneurysm rupture (80% of non-traumatic)
        - Vascular malformation (< 10% of non-traumatic)
        - Intracranial artery dissection, extension of ICH
- What is a berry aneurysm? Where do they form?
    - Most non-traumatic SAH are caused by rupture of intracranial saccular (Berry) aneurysms (outpouchings)
        - 85% are in the anterior circulation, mostly near major arterial branch points (due to high pressure turbulent flow)
        - Risk of rupture is greatest when the aneurysm diameter is between 6-10mm
    - Common sites (multiple may exist)
        - Anterior
            - Junction of AComm with ACA (40%)
            - Junction of PComm with ICA (20%)
            - Bifurcation of MCA (34%)
        - Posterior
            - Bifurcation of basilar artery (4%)
            - Junction of basilar and SCA or AICA
- Types of intracranial aneurysms
    - Saccular (most common)
        - Very thin or absent tunica media and internal elastic lamina
    - Fusiform
        - Dilation of entire circumference, associated with atherosclerosis
    - Mycotic
        - Due to infected emboli
- Investigative approach for SAH
    - Important to have a high index of suspicion → consider in any acute onset severe headache
    - Principal diagnostic approach
        - Concurrent assessment and resuscitation (ABCDE)
            - Assess NIHSS stroke scale for likelihood of a stroke
        - Key investigations
            - Non-contrast CT → diagnostic for SAH in > 90% of cases
            - If negative CT but clinical suspicion → LP
                - May have elevated opening pressure
                - Elevated RBC count (stays elevated across tube 1 → 4)
                - Xanthochromia (pink or yellow tint representing haemoglobin degradation products)
        - Identify source of bleeding
            - Digital subtraction angiography
                - May be both diagnostic and therapeutic → **best for detecting aneurysms**
            - CT or MR angiography (DDx RCVS or cervical artery dissection)
    - Ancillary investigations

            - Further imaging - MRI brain with contrast if a tumour is suspected
- Pathophysiology of SAH - formation, rupture, manifestations
    - Formation of aneurysms
        - Acquired - degenerative process
            - Absence or weakening of tunica media and internal elastic lamina of intracranial vessels
            - Associated with chronic injury states (hypertension, smoking) **[multifactorial]**
        - Predisposing conditions include ADPKD, fibromuscular dysplasia due to intrinsic defects in connective tissue
    - Rupture
        - Associated in many cases with systemic hypertension
            - May be transient (physical exertion, emotional stress, caffeine consumption or cocaine)
        - Most are caused by aneurysms which form quickly (hours - weeks) and rupture at a critical size)
- Complications of SAH
    - Life-threatening
        - Raised ICP (blood, oedema) → herniation syndrome
        - Complications from stroke and hospitalisation
            - DVT or PE
            - Aspiration pneumonia or infection → sepsis
    - Acute
        - Re-bleeding and extension of injury (5-15% of patients within 24h)
        - Vasospasm (4-14 days later) due to breakdown of blood products releasing spasmogenic substances
            - Leads to ischaemia and infarction
        - Seizures
        - Sterile meningitis (irritation of meninges by blood products)
        - Intra-ocular haemorrhage (Terson’s syndrome)
    - Subacute or chronic (weeks, months)
        - Hydrocephalus
            - Obstruction to CSF flow may present as a acute complication
            - Blockage of reabsorption due to blood products or adhesions (late) [fibrosis of granulations or foramina]

        - FHx
    - Modifiable
        - Hypertension
        - Drugs
            - Smoking, excess EtOH, amphetamine use
- Prognosis of SAH
    - Overall mortality is 50% within 2-3 weeks
        - 1/3 of patients immediately die
        - 1/3 left with permanent neurological damage
        - 1/3 will recover
    - Prognosis depends on the site of bleeding, severity, complications and treatment availability
    - Predictors of mortality on admission

                - Higher risk of recurrent bleeding and incomplete obliteration
            - Microsurgical clipping → neurosurgery
                - Lower rate of rebleeding and can treat large intracerebral haematoma at the same time

        - Hydrocephalus (obstruction of CSF flow or reduction of CSF reabsorption due to blood products or adhesions)
        - Other factors → reactive hyperaemia post-haemorrhage, brain swelling post infarction
- Anatomy - layers of the scalp
    - SCALP (first three layers are tightly adherent)
        - Skin
        - Connective tissue (dense)
            - Richly vascularised and innervated to supply the skin and structures above
            - Anastomotic network of ECA branches (superficial temporal, posterior auricular, occipital)

- Anatomy - venous drainage of the brain
    - General
        - Sinuses are valveless → drain by siphonage
        - Lie between two layers of dura (except inferior sagittal and straight which are between two folds of the inner layer)
    - Can be divided into superficial and deep drainage pathways
        - Superficial structures → dural venous sinuses (channels between two dural layers)
            - Via superior, superficial middle and inferior cerebral veins
        - Deep structures → internal cerebral vein → great cerebral vein (of Galen) → straight sinus
        - All ultimately drain to the internal jugular vein
    - Venous sinuses
        - Superior sagittal sinus (along falx cerebri)
            - From frontal crest (or foramen caecum of frontal bone) to internal occipital protuberance

- Anatomy - ventricular system
    - Pathway of CSF formation and drainage
        - Produced from a filtrate of plasma by:
            - Choroid plexus (mostly) in third, fourth and lateral ventricles
                - Specialised blood vessel formed of capillaries, pia and cuboidal ependymal cells
            - 30% from other brain capillaries which seep into the system by the ECF
        - Pathway
            - Lateral ventricles → interventricular foramen (Monro) → third ventricle → cerebral aqueduct → fourth ventricle → two lateral foramina (Luschka) or midline foramen (Magendie) → subarachnoid space
        - Reabsorption (two pathways)
            - Mostly to the venous circulation via the arachnoid granulations into the dural venous sinuses
            - Some into the lymphatic system through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid (nasal tissues, lymphatics)

    - Volume and function of CSF
        - Volume: 130mL of CSF (30mL in ventricles, 75mL in spinal subarachnoid space, 25mL in cranial subarachnoid space)
            - 500mL/day produced however constant recirculation and absorption maintains steady volume
        - Function
            - Protective buffer for neural tissue
            - Waterbath to support the weight of the brain
            - Removal of brain metabolites (blood-CSF barrier formed by selective transport of ependymal cells)

        - Communicating
            - Increased CSF production (rare → papilloma of choroid plexus)
            - Decreased reabsorption through scarring or obliteration of arachnoid villi)
                - E.g. post meningitis or SAH

        - Non-communicating
            - Obstructive
