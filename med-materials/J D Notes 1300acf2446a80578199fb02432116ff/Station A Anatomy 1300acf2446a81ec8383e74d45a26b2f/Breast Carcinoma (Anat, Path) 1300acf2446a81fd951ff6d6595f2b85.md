# Breast Carcinoma (Anat, Path)

## Case Protocol 7 – **Breast Carcinoma**

**Case:**

*A 36-year-old woman presented to her local doctor after noticing a lump in her breast. Her sister had recently had a benign breast lump removed. Examination revealed a 1 cm mass in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast. The lesion was firm and non-tender, without attachment to deeper structures. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy.*

- PDx
    - Given the patient’s age, and that the lump is firm, not tethered and no apparent lymphadenopathy, my PDx is a benign fibrous or cystic lesion
        - Most concerning diagnosis would be carcinoma of the breast
- DDx for palpable breast masses
    - Neoplasia
        - Breast tumours
            - Benign
                - Fibroadenoma
                    - Most common benign neoplasm of the breast (fibroelastic stroma and epithelium lined glands)
                    - Mobile and oestrogen sensitive
                - Intraductal papilloma
                    - Associated with bloody or serous nipple discharge
                - Phyllodes (collection of connective tissue and cysts)

        - SHx
        - Screen breast cancer RFs
    - Examination
        - Inspection
            - Begin by having the patient rest their arms by their sides
            - Ask them to lean over
            - Ask them to raise their arms above their head
            - Examine both breasts and assess for asymmetry
            - Have the patient place their hands on their hips and push into them
                - Will activate pectoralis muscle - allow inspection of the axilla for the tail of the breast
            - Assess the contours of the breast, skin changes, nipple abnormalities
                - Look for any peau d’orange, nipple retraction, discharge, inflammatory changes
        - Palpation
            - Have the patient lie supine with the ipsilateral arm placed behind their head
            - Palpate from the clavicle to the lower rib, mid-axillary line to sternal edge
            - Note size, site, shape, texture, mobility, consistency, overlying skin
        - Examine regional lymph nodes

            - Lymphadenopathy (unilateral)
- Risk factors for breast cancer
    - Non-modifiable
        - Age > 60
        - Previous breast cancer or pre-cancerous lesions (atypical hyperplasia)
            - Fibrocystic change alone does not predispose to breast cancer
        - Hyper-oestrogenism
            - Early menarche (< 12) or late menopause (> 55)
            - Nulliparity
            - Hormone replacement therapy

            - Known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations
    - Modifiable
        - Alcohol and somking
        - Post-menopausal obesity
- Does fibrocystic change predispose to malignancy?
    - Non-proliferative types (stroma, simple cyst formation, apocrine metaplasia) usually DO NOT increase risk
    - Some subtypes may increase risk:
        - Moderate to florid hyperplasia (without atypia), ductal papillomatosis, sclerosing adenosis
        - Atypical hyperplasia (ductal or lobular) - significant increased risk
- What is the triple assessment for breast cancer
    - Gold standard for diagnosis
    - Clinical assessment: history and physical examination
    - Medical imaging
        - Mammography for older women
            - Focal poorly defined lesions with spiculated margins (infiltrating)
                - Cancer in 90% of cases
            - Clustered microcalcifications (necrotic centres of tumour cell clusters)
                - Multifocal disease → multiple areas within 1 breast quadrant
                - Multicentric disease → multiple areas within several breast quadrants
        - Ultrasound for younger women (dense breast tissue)
            - Hyperechoic mass or calcification
    - Tissue biopsy
        - Receptor status (ER, PR, HER2)
        - Genetic screening
- What is a frozen section? Advantages? disadvantages?
    - Frozen section is an intraoperative biopsy
        - Tissue samples from an excision biopsy are analysed immediately allowing for a rapid preliminary report of the histological nature of the mass
    - Process
        - Tissue section excised and marked (orientation)
        - Frozen with liquid nitrogen
        - Mounted, sliced and stained for examination
    - Advantages
        - High specificity (low FP)
        - Reduces the need for repeat procedures
            - Can be conducted as part of a sentinel LN biopsy → can determine if the LN has metastasised and if a complete axillary LN dissection needs to be performed
            - Can be used to determine clear margins
    - Disadvantages
        - May have false negatives (freezing/fixation → distortion)
        - Not ideal as first diagnostic method (patient cannot adjust to Dx, seek other treatment options)
- Compare and contrast methods of biopsy
    - Core needle biopsy is first-line in most cases
        - Method
            - Small skin incision
            - Insertion of a core biopsy needle (14g) under local anaesthetic
            - Can use ultrasound or stereotactic guidance
        - Advantages
            - Structural architecture
            - Can perform ER, PR, HER2 testing
            - Sensitive and specific
    - Fine needle aspirate with intraprocedural cytopathology is an alternative for fast management
        - Method
            - Thin (23-25G) needle is inserted into mass to collect cells which are then examined under a microscope
        - Advantages
            - Fast and least invasive
            - Rapid results
        - Disadvantages
            - Low sensitivity (high FN as can miss the cancer)
            - Can only provide a cytological sample i.e. no tissue architecture → can’t distinguish invasive vs in situ
    - Surgical biopsy
        - Useful when CNB results are inconclusive or discordant with imaging findings
        - Can be incisional (partial) or excisional (whole)
        - Higher complication rates
    - Skin punch biopsy can be used to differentiate between benign and malignant changes (e.g. Paget disease, inflammatory breast cancer, skin involvement with invasive breast cancer)
- Main histological types of breast cancer
    - 95% of breast cancer is adenocarcinoma
    - Non-invasive (early malignancy without basement membrane penetration)
        - Ductal carcinoma in situ (80%)
            - Frequently diagnosed due to microcalcifications detectable on mammography
            - 30% can progress to invasive ductal carcinoma
                - Comedo DCIS → central necrosis
                - Non-comedo → multiple patterns (papillary, cribriform)
            - Paget’s disease can result from DCIS
                - Dermatitis response to intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells which travel along the duct but are not truly invasive
        - Lobular carcinoma in situ
            - Lobulocentric proliferation of monomorphic cells which fill and distend lobular units
                - Discohesive cell growth (lack of E-cadherin - tumour suppressor protein)
                - Often bilateral with no mass or calcification
            - 1% progress to invasive
            - more extensive than what radiology/imaging suggests → management more inclined mastectomy
    - Invasive carcinomas
        - Ductal carcinoma
            - Strong desmoplastic response = hard palpable mass (activation of myofibroblasts)
                - Mostly unifocal and unilateral
                - Classically a ‘stellate’ infiltration
            - Subclassifications
                - No special type
                - Special type
                    - Papillary (90% are ER positive)
                    - Mucinous
                    - Tubular
                    - Medullary (rare, associated with BRCA1, usually triple negative)
        - Lobular carcinoma
            - Cells often invade as ‘single file’ strands or chains
                - Often multifocal and bilateral
        - Inflammatory carcinoma
            - Enlarged, swollen and erythematous breast due to diffusely infiltrative, poorly differentiated carcinoma
                - Lymphatic involvement → swelling, peau d’orange
            - Terrible prognosis
- Molecular subtypes of breast cancer
    - Subtypes based on global gene expression profiling - has prognostic implications
    - Ki-67 levels correlate with increased proliferation
        - Luminal B has worse prognosis than Luminal A
        - HER2 can be treated with Herceptin
        - Triple negative has the worst prognosis
    
    |  | Oestrogen | Progesterone | HER2 | Ki-67 | Genes |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Luminal A | + | +/- | - | Low |  |
    | Luminal B | + | +/- | +/- | High |  |
    | HER2 | - | - | + | High |  |
    | Triple negative (basal-like) | - | - | - | High | BRCA1 association |
- Pathophysiology of invasive ductal carcinoma
    1. Complex polygenic and environmental factors (risk factors, hormonal milieu) which confers increased susceptibility or initial changes in the cell
    2. Genetic mutations accumulate in ductal epithelial cells 
        1. Include mutations to proto-oncogenes (HER2) (render them oncogenic) and tumour suppressors (p53, BRCA)
    3. Cells undergo further genetic and histological change
        1. Proliferate inappropriately → atypical ductal hyperplasia or atypical apocrine adenosis before progressing to DCIS
        2. Low grade DCIS and atypical hyperplasia share cytological and architectural features
    4. Further genetic aberrations confer invasive properties (cells extend beyond basement membrane)
        1. Acquire epithelial to mesenchymal transition and expression of matrix metalloproteinases
        2. Forms invasive carcinoma
    5. In established tumour, significant heterogeneity exists within multiple sub-populations of cells (many genetic aberrations, some aid survival and balance tends to favour these cells)
    6. Metastasis occurs via further mutation and allows spread via lymphatic or haematogenous routes
- Staging breast cancer
    - Staged using the TNM system
        - T- tumour size or invasiveness into chest wall/skin
        - N - site and size of involved nodes
        - M - presence of metastases
    - Prognostic stage groups by HER2, ER and PR receptor status
- Grading breast cancer
    - Nottingham system (Bloom-Richardson) is used to grade breast cancer
        - Score out of 3 for each of the following categories:
            - Tubule formation (proportion of tissue showing glandular differentiation)
            - Nuclear pleiomorphism (size, hyperchromasia)
            - Mitotic rate
        - Grade 1 = 3-5
        - Grade 2 = 6-7
        - Grade 3 = 8-9
- Prognosis in breast cancer
    - Patient factors → age, comorbidities, functional status (physiological reserve)
    - Disease factors
        - Histological subtypes
        - Stage
            - Molecular subtype
        - Grade
- Van Nuys Prognostic indicator
    - Tool → predict DCIS aggressiveness and local recurrence probability post-op
    - Score depends on:
        - Patient age (>60, 40-60, <40)
        - Tumour size (<15mm, 16-40, >41)
        - Margins (>10mm, 1-9, <1)
        - Pathology (non-high grade without necrosis, non-high grade with necrosis, high grade)
    - Score is summed (range 4-12)
        - Low risk (4-6) → lumpectomy without radiotherapy
        - Intermediate (7-9) → lumpectomy with radiotherapy
        - High (10-12) → mastectomy recommended
- Sentinel lymph node biopsy
    - Sentinel lymph nodes: first drainage nodes for area invaded by malignant cells
        - Sentinel node status (tumour free/not free; via biopsy) helps determine whether complete axillary lymph node dissection is needed (minimise complications and cost)
    - Method
        - Injection of tracers into the breast (subareolar plexus, intradermal) (not tumour)
            - Tracers can be methylene blue dye, radioactive tracer
        - Nodes can be axillary or internal thoracic (parasternal)
    - Pathophysiology of arm swelling post surgery
        - Lymphoedema (non-pitting) of the arm is the most likely explanation
            - Operative damage to the lymphatic system from surgery (e.g. with dissection and removal)
                - Potential increased risk from radiotherapy
            - Tumour invasion impairing lymphatic drainage
        - Axillary vein obstruction → pitting oedema, warm, erythematous
            - Tumour recurrence
            - Thrombosis
- Clinical features of disease recurrence
    - Recurrent disease can be detected clinically or radiologically (surveillance mammogram)
    - Clinical features
        - Local invasion
            - Nipple retraction
            - Tethering
            - Peau d’orange (invasion of dermal lymphatics)
        - Lymphatic - axillary
        - Haematogenous
            - Sxs of mets disease (haemoptysis, dyspnoea, focal neurology or seizures, back pain or difficulty walking)
        - Signs of malignancy (constitutional sxs: fever, weight loss, night sweats)
- Surgical management of breast cancer
    - Breast conserving surgery
        - Excision of the mass or cancer (lumpectomy) often followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to treat possible micro-metastases or residual tumour at the margins
            - Preferred mode of treatment if possible (less psychosocial consequences, no impact on outcomes)
        - Contraindications
            - Previous radiotherapy to affected area (increased risk of secondary malignancy)
            - Inability to undergo radiation therapy post-surgery
    - Mastectomy (preferably skin sparing)
        - Types
            - Total (removal of breast and nipple-areolar complex with sparing of pectoral muscles)
            - Skin-sparing (allows for simultaneous breast reconstruction)
                - Nipple sparing (variation)
            - Radical (excision of breast, pectoralis muscles, axillary lymph nodes)
- Non-surgical treatment modalities
    - Radiotherapy
        - Classically adjuvant to surgery in patients at high risk of local recurrence (nodal disease, deep cancer margins)
        - Complications (swelling, tenderness, burns, ILD, cosmetic changes (skin thickening), secondary malignancy (angiosarcoma)
    - Hormonal therapy
        - SERMs (tamoxifen)
            - Used for ER+/PR+ cancers in pre-menopausal women
                - Can cause increased risk of VTE, stroke, menopausal symptoms, endometrial cancer
        - Aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole)
            - For ER+/PR+ cancers in post-menopausal women
                - Inhibits conversion of androgens to oestrogens in adipose tissue
                - Can cause menopausal symptoms, arthralgias, osteoporosis
    - Immunotherapy
        - Trastuzumab (Herceptin) for HER2/NEU receptor positive tumours
            - Monoclonal antibody which binds to human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) (tyrosine kinase) → inhibits HER2 initiated cellular signalling and proliferation
            - AEs: cardiotoxicity, nausea and vomiting, lethargy, flu-like symptoms
    - Chemotherapy
        - Can be curative or palliative, neoadjuvant or adjuvant
            - Often used for metastatic disease unresponsive to hormone therapy
        - Usually combination therapy
        - AEs: myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, organ toxicity
- Significance of family history in breast cancer
    - Most breast cancers occur sporadically
        - Only ~5-10% due to known genetic conditions
            - BRCA1, BRCA2
            - Li-Fraumeni syndrome (TP53)
            - Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (STK11 gene)
        - More likely to carry mutated gene if:
            - Sig. FHx - multiple first degree relatives (2x if 1, 3x if 2)
            - Develop breast cancer before menopause
            - Have bilateral disease
            - Develop certain subtypes of cancer (e.g. triple negative)
            - Have other associated cancers (e.g. ovarian)
    - Women with a 1st degree FHx are eligible for early access to the NBCSP (> 40 years)
    - 1st deg relative + premenopausal = more likely genetic
        - esp younger age possible auto dom BRCA1/2 (minority case only)
- Mammography
    - National Breast Cancer Screening Program
        - 2 yearly mammogram in 50-74 year olds
    - Mammography
        - Low density X-ray of breast tissue used to identify early signs of breast cancer
        - Requires compression of breast (uniform thickness and reduces motion artefact)
        - May require follow-up with ultrasound guided core needle biopsy

### Memorandum: breast cancer with spinal metastases (anatomy)

**Case 1:** *A 36-year-old woman presented to her local doctor after noticing a lump in her breast. On examination, there was 1cm mass in the lower right quadrant of the right breast that was firm and non-tender without attachment to deeper structures. On neurological examination, she has weakness of her right upper limb including weak elbow/wrist extension and loss of triceps reflex. Loss of pain and sensation was also present from the right side below the axilla.*

**Case 2:**

*She had neck pain and weakness in her left upper limb. She had weak elbow flexion. Loss of pain was also present from her right index finger to the ulnar aspect of her wrist.*

- Anatomy of the breast
    - Paired structures on the anterior thoracic wall
        - Located in the subcutaneous fascia overlying the pectoralis major and serratus anterior muscles (anterior 2nd to 6th rib)
    - Components
        - Two regions
            - Circular body (central nipple and areola)
            - Axillary tail (lies in medial axillary wall, may penetrate the deep fascia of axilla)
        - Three main elements
            - Mammary glands
                - Modified sweat glands comprised of secretory lobules of alveoli and ducts
                - Each lobule drained by a lactiferous duct
            - Fibrous and fatty CT stroma
                - Fibrous components form septa which divide the breast into lobules
                    - Suspensory ligaments (Cooper’s) are the largest → connect skin to the posterior capsule (condensation of Scarpa’s fascia)
    - Retromammary space lies behind the breast (blood vessels, lymph nodes)
- Arterial and venous drainage of the breast
    - Blood supply through an anastomotic network:
        - Medial
            - Internal thoracic artery (from subclavian)
        - Lateral
            - Lateral thoracic artery (from axillary)
            - Intercostal arteries (from thoracic aorta) → give off mammary branches to the breast
            - Pectoral branches of the thoracoacromial artery (from axillary)
    - Venous drainage follow arteries to the axillary and internal thoracic veins
        - Some drainage may occur to posterior intercostal veins to batson’s venous plexus → lumbar vertebral/dural sinus mets possible.
- Lymphatic drainage of the breast
    - Axillary node pathway (75%)
        - Upper and lower lateral quadrants drain to infraclavicular and axillary nodes
            - Drain to subclavian trunk to R lymphatic or thoracic
    - Internal mammary pathway (25%)
        - Upper and lower medial quadrants drain through the intercostal spaces into the internal thoracic (parasternal) nodes along the internal thoracic artery
            - Drain to bronchomediastinal trunks → R lymphatic or thoracic
    - Other drainage pathways are possible
        - Contralateral breast
        - Cervical nodes
- Axillary lymph node anatomy
    - Anterior (pectoral)
        - Lie along the inferior border of the pectoralis minor (with lateral thoracic artery)
        - Receives lymph from:
            - Upper half of the anterior trunk
            - Major part of breast
    - Posterior (subscapular)
        - Lies along the medial wall of the axilla (posteriorly) with subscapular artery
        - Receives lymph from:
            - Upper half of posterior trunk
            - Axillary tail of breast
    - Lateral (humeral)
        - Lies posteromedial to axillary vein
        - Receives lymph from:
            - Upper limb
    - Central
        - Lies in the fat of the axilla
        - Receives lymph from the above groups
    - Apical
        - Lies in the apex of the axilla - receives from the above
        - Drains via the subclavian trunk into the supraclavicular nodes → R lymphatic and thoracic duct
    - Axillary lymph node levels
        - I: lateral or below pectoralis minor
        - II: underneath pectoralis minor
        - III: medial or above pectoralis minor
- Nerve supply of the breast
    - Sensory: intercostal nerves T4-T6 (skin)
    - Sympathetic fibres to blood vessels and glands
        - Lactation control is hormonal
- Compare UMN and LMN
    
    
    |  | UMN | LMN |

### Memorandum (Pathology): Fibrocystic Breast Change

- What are fibrocystic breasts?
    - Characterised by “lumpy” breasts associated with pain and tenderness
        - Fluctuate with the breast cycle
        - Often have a ‘ropey’ texture owing to nodularity
        - Bilateral, diffuse, symmetrical
    - Do not necessarily correlate with a increased risk of breast cancer → a broad spectrum of conditions
        - Atypical hyperplasia has an increased risk
    - Risk factors
        - Obesity, nulliparity, HRT (oestrogen)
        - Late onset menopause
        - Later age of first child
- What are the guidelines for screening breast cancer
    - Every 2 years if normal risk (50-74)
    - **Moderate increased risk - breast check education, consider annual check up. Consider screening from age 40 if relative Dx < 50 years**
        - First degree relative Dx before age 50
        - Two first degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer, same side of family
        - Two relatives, diagnosed with breast cancer, at least 1 before age 50
    - **Potentially high risk - consider referral to family genetic clinic + regular screening + specialist referral**
        - Women at high risk of ovarian cancer
        - Two 1st or 2nd degree relatives Dx with breast or ovarian cancer + 1 more of following on same side:
            - Additional relative with breast or ovarian
            - Breast Ca dx < age 40
            - Bilateral breast Ca
            - Breast and ovarian Ca in same woman
            - Jewish ancestry
            - Breast Ca in a male relative
        - One 1st or 2nd degree relative Dx with breast Ca < 45 + another on same side with sarcoma Dx < 45 years
        - Member of family with high risk breast cancer gene mutation
- How would you explain what DCIS is and its prognosis?
    - Detectable with screening due to calcifications
    - Excellent prognosis
        - ≥ 97% long-term survival with simple mastectomy
        - 1/3 of women with small areas of untreated DCIS of low nuclear grade will eventually develop invasive carcinoma
- Subtypes of DCIS
    - Comedo
        - Cells with high grade nuclei and extensive central necrosis
        - Named after the toothpaste-like necrotic tissue which extrudes from transected ducts on application of gentle pressure
    - Non-comedo
        - Cribriform
        - Papillary
        - Micropapillary
        - “Clinging”
- Differentiating DCIS from invasive? Compare microscopic changes
    - Histological
        - In situ carcinomas do not invade past the basement membrane
        - Invasive tends to have a strong desmoplastic response with a heterogenous appearance (well differentiated → anaplastic)
            - Irregular tumour margins and invasion of lymphovascular spaces
    - Clinical
        - Invasive tends to be adherent and fixed to pectoral muscles or deep fascia of chest wall and overlying skin
            - Associated with nipple retraction or dimpling of skin
        - May involve lymphatic pathways (lymphedema)
- Polycystic ovary syndrome
    - Clinical syndrome of ≥ 2/3 of following with exclusion of other disorders (Rotterdam 2003)
        - Hyperandrogenism (symptoms and signs)
            - Hirsutism (androgen distribution), acne, hyperhidrosis,
        - Oligo- or anovulation
        - Polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound
    - Most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age
        - Leading cause of infertility and pregnancy complications
    - Associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD
        - Increased risk of developing T2DM
    - Investigations (exclude other DDx)
        - Largely a diagnosis of exclusion which requires careful Hx and examination
        - Principal supporting Dx
            - Pelvic US (demonstrate ovarian cysts)
                - ≥ 20 follicles measuring 2-9mm OR increased ovarian volume in either or both ovaries
            - Hyperandrogenaemia
                - Serum total and free testosterone
                - Serum DHEAS
        - Metabolic complications
            - Fasting BSL, HBA1c, OGTT
            - Fasting lipid panel
        - Exclude DDx
            - Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone
                - Exclude 21-hydroxylase deficienct adult-onset adrenal hyperplasia
            - Serum prolactin (cause of oligo- or anovulation)
            - TSH (may explain menstrual irregularities)
    - Management
        - Improvement of fertility
            - Weight loss (may restore fertility through reducing hyperinsulinaemia and high androgens)
                - Consider adding metformin if lifestyle measures insufficient
            - Aromatase inhibitors (e.g. letrozole)
                - MOA: reduce conversion of androgens to oestrogen
                    - Reduces negative feedback on HPG axis and increases FSH
            - Clomifene (non-steroidal anti-oestrogen)
                - Inhibits negative feedback on HPG and increases FSH
        - Treat hyperandrogenism
            - OCP (reduce acne) [use less androgenic progesterones]
            - Consider anti-androgens (e.g. spironolactone, finasteride)
                - Second line due to teratogenic potential
