        - Absent cremasteric reflex
            - Ipsilateral testis elevation in response to stroking or pinching of upper thigh
- Investigative approach to testicular torsion
    - A clinical diagnosis → scored using Hx and exam

            - **Twisting of the spermatic cord**
- Management of testicular torsion
    - Definitve
        - Surgical detorsion and fixation (orchioplexy) → **URGENT (SIX HOURS)**
            - Orchiectomy if testis is non-viable
        - Bilateral fixation (reduce risk of contralateral torsion)
    - If surgical management if unavailable or delayed
        - Manual detorsion (under sedation and anaesthesia)
            - Improves probability of testicular salvage
        - Orchiplexy still should be performed even if successful (risk of continued partial torsion or retorsion)
- Pathophysiology of testicular torsion
    - **Caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, often within the tunica vaginalis**
        - Results in venous outflow obstruction and arterial occlusion
            - Oedema → ischaemia and necrosis
    - Three proposed mechanisms
        - Intravaginal torsion is most common
            - Associated with Bell-Clapper deformity
            - Congenital abnormality where tunica vaginalis attaches abnormally high on spermatic cord
                - Increases mobility of testis in tunica and predisposes to torsion
        - Extravaginal
            - Lack of fixation of tunica vaginalis to the gubernaculum at inferior pole
        - Long mesorchium
            - Mesorchium is a ligament which connects the testis and the epididymis

- What is the cremasteric reflex
    - Lightly stroking or poking the superior medial aspect of the thigh causes contraction of the cremaster muscle
        - Pulls the testis up on the ipsilateral side
    - Afferent: ilioinguinal nerve
    - Efferent: motor fibres of genitofemoral nerve
- Explain the layers of the scrotum and their derivations
    - Testes and associated structures pass through the deep and superficial inguinal rings during embryological development
        - Associated with coverings from the abdominal wall
    
    | Layer of scrotum or cord | Layer of abdominal wall |
    | --- | --- |
    | Skin | Skin |
    | Dartos muscle | Scarpa’s fascia |
    | External spermatic fascia | External oblique aponeurosis |
    | Cremasteric muscle | Internal oblique aponeurosis and muscle |
    | Internal spermatic fascia | Transversalis fascia |
    | Parietal layer of tunica vaginalis | Parietal peritoneum |
    | Visceral layer of tunica vaginalis | Testicular in origin |
    | Tunica albuginea | Testicular in origin |

- Deep inguinal ring
    - Lies above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament
        - Lateral to mid-inguinal point
        - Opening in the transversalis fascia as it projects along the inguinal canal
    - Boundaries
        - Lateral
            - Angle between transversus abdominis and inguinal ligament
        - Medial
            - Transversalis fascia → projected along the canal (interfoveolar ligament)

- Superficial inguinal ring
    - V-shaped opening formed by fibres of the external oblique aponeurosis
        - Landmark is **1cm superior and lateral to pubic tubercle**
    - Attachments
        - Medial crus attached to pubic symphysis
        - Lateral crus attached to the pubic tubercle
        - At the junction of the crura, there are perpendicular intercrural fibres (landmark for superficial ring)
    - Some fibres from the lateral crus pass behind the cord and medial crus to blend with the opposite side
        - Reflected part of the inguinal ligament → forms a posterior crus of the contralateral external oblique aponeurosis

- Testis - structure
    - Oval organ
    - Covering
        - Parenchyma protected by tunica albuginea (fibrous capsule)
        - Penetrates parenchyma with fibrous septa and divides it into lobules
        - Anterior and lateral surfaces of testis lie free within a serous space formed by tunica vaginalis
        
        ![paste-e1f5ea167af9f9541492528ea74d6b4ba47faa08.jpg](Testicular%20torsion%20(Anat)%201300acf2446a813c9239c7f27e5a9cf1/paste-e1f5ea167af9f9541492528ea74d6b4ba47faa08.jpg)
        
    - Parenchyma
        - Divided into lobules consisting of seminiferous tubules supported by interstitial tissue
            - Tubules lined by Sertoli cells which aid the maturation of spermatozoa and produce hormones (e.g. inhibin)
            - Interstitial Leydig cells are responsible for testosterone production
        - Mediastinum testis (fibrous mass on convergent septa in posterolateral part of testis)
            - Contains rete testis → efferent ductules → epididymis
    - Epididymis
        - A single, heavily-coiled duct on the posterolateral surface of testis
            - Continuous with ductus deferens → involved in storage and maturation of sperm
        - Anterolateral surface is covered by tunica vaginalis
        - Can be divided into head, body and tail
        
        ![paste-44bcb94da7419ae158969746d6f2ecf4b0feba5f.jpg](Testicular%20torsion%20(Anat)%201300acf2446a813c9239c7f27e5a9cf1/paste-44bcb94da7419ae158969746d6f2ecf4b0feba5f.jpg)
        
    - Appendix testis
        - Sessile cyst attached to the upper pole of testis
        - Remnant of paramesonephric duct
- Testis - arterial supply
    - Testicular artery (from aorta → L2 (below SMA and renal artery)) runs in the spermatic cord
        - Gives branch to epididymis
        - Near epididymis, there is an anastomosis between the testicular, cremasteric and ductus arteries
    - Other arteries (minimal contribution to testicular supply)
        - Cremasteric → supplies cremaster muscle and coverings of cors
            - External iliac → inferior epigastric → cremasteric
        - Ductus deferens artery
            - Internal iliac → inferior or superior vesical → artery to DD
    
    ![paste-720a18fc65ad13cb628b6873a0ece843422be1fe.jpg](Testicular%20torsion%20(Anat)%201300acf2446a813c9239c7f27e5a9cf1/paste-720a18fc65ad13cb628b6873a0ece843422be1fe.jpg)
    
- Testis - nerve supply
    - Sympathetic nerves (no PSNS)
        - Most preganglionic cell bodies reside in T10 (lateral horn)
        - Enter the sympathetic trunk via white rami communicans and pass through without synapsing
            - Greater or lesser splanchnic nerve
            - Coeliac ganglion (synapse)
            - Post-ganglionic fibres travel with testicular artery
        - GVA run with sympathetic pathway (T10 DRG)
    - Scrotum nerve supply
        - Sensory supply from genitofemoral nerve (L1-2) and ilioinguinal nerve (L1)
- Testis - venous drainage
    - Several veins draining testis parenchyma pass upward in the spermatic cord and surround the testicular artery
        - Forms pampiniform plexus
        - Involved in countercurrent heat exchange
            - Testis require 2-4 degrees lower temperature for spermatogenesis
    - Course
        - In spermatic canal → plexus joins into testicular veins
        - In deep inguinal ring → four veins join into two
        - One valvular vein intra-abdominally
            - L testicular vein → L renal vein
            - R testicular vein → IVC

- Testis and scrotum - lymph drainage
    - Testis
        - Lymphatic vessels lie between seminiferous tubules (not within) and drain with the testicular artery to **para-aortic nodes**
            - L2 level → just above umbilicus
        - Path of para-aortic nodes
            - Para-aortic → cisterna chyli → thoracic duct → L subclavian vein
            - Metastasis can block the thoracic duct and produce regurgitation to surrounding nodes (e.g. Virchow node metastasis)
    - Scrotum
        - Drains to superficial inguinal nodes → external iliac nodes

- Inferior epigastric artery
    - Branch of the external iliac artery, proximal to the inguinal ligament
    - Course
        - Arises deep to the transversalis fascia and perforates it as it slants upwards and medial
        - Superficial to the fascia, it passes over the arcuate line to enter the rectus sheath (posterior to muscle)
            - Raises the lateral umbilical ligament
    - Branches
        - At the deep inguinal ring
            - Cremasteric branch to muscle and cord coverings
        - Pubic branch to periosteum of superior pubic ramus
            - May anastomose with obturator artery → corona mortis

- Scarpa and Camper’s fascia
    - Scarpa = internal membranous fascia
    - Camper = external fatty layer
