- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: laryngeal cancer → most commonly SCC
        - Given patient age, gender, smoking history and dysphonia
    - DDx for dysphonia
        - Benign vocal fold lesions
            - **Polyps** (most common → due to irritation)
            - **Nodules** (fibrotic)
            - Granulomas (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis)
            - Reinke oedema (inflammatory disorder associated with smoking)
        - Pre-malignant lesions
            - Leukoplakia
            - Papillomatosis (HPV-associated)
        - Non-mass causes of dysphonia
            - Neurological dysfunction (stroke, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy)
            - Functional dysphonia or acute voice misuse
            - **Viral laryngitis**
- Clinical features of laryngeal cancer
    - Hoarseness or voice change
    - Sensation of foreign body in throat
    - Stridor +/- dyspnoea
    - Dysphagia or odynophagia
    - Aspiration or regurgitation events whilst drinking or eating
- Investigative approach to laryngeal cancer
    - Diagnostic investigations
        - Gold standard is direct laryngoscopy and biopsy of lesion
            - Rigid (transoral)
            - Flexible (transnasal) → able to asses function
        - CT neck OR MRI neck with contrast
            - Look for extent of local disease, nodal involvement (staging)
            - MRI can better differentiate cartilage involvement
        - Palpable neck mass
            - Ultrasound + FNA or core needle biopsy
    - Further investigations for staging
        - CT CAP
        - PET CT
- Classification of laryngeal cancers
    - Type
        - 95% squamous cell carcinoma
        - Adenocarcinoma
    - Location
        - Supraglottic (40%)
            - Arises from epiglottis, aryepiglottic fold, false vocal cord
            - Rich lymphatic supply and often spread to cervical nodes
        - Glottic (60%)
            - Involve vocal cords → often confined to the larynx
            - Better prognosis (early detection with voice changes)
        - Subglottic or transglottic
- Risk factors for laryngeal cancer
    - Most important risk factors are smoking and excessive alcohol consumption
    - Non-modifiable
        - Older age (> 40)
        - Male (M:F is 7:1)
        - Irradiation of the head and neck
    - Modifiable
        - Smoking
        - Excessive alcohol consumption
        - HPV infection (16 or 18) → SCC
        - Immunosuppression
- Laryngeal cancer - mechanism of spread
    - Local extension
        - Contralateral vocal cord
        - Trachea

    - Lymphatic spread
    - Haematogenous spread
        - Lungs, liver (IJV)
        - Bone (via cervical veins to internal vertebral venous plexus)
- Anatomy of the larynx
    - Larynx is found in the neck (C3-C6)
        - Connects laryngopharynx to the trachea
    - Laryngeal cartilages
        - Thyroid cartilage (hyaline)
            - Two quadrilateral laminae → anterior borders form the laryngeal prominence
                - Prominence is larger in men and at a sharper angle
                - Associated with longer vocal cords and a deeper voice
        - Cricoid cartilage (hyaline)
            - Signet-ring shaped cartilage which articulates with the thyroid cartilage at the cricothyroid joint (synovial)
        - Arytenoid cartilage (hyaline)
            - Pyramidal
                - Muscular process (lateral) and vocal process (anterior)
        - Corniculate cartilage (elastic fibrocartilage)
            - In the aryepiglottic fold (strengthens it)
        - Cuneiform (elastic fibrocartilage)
            - Paired cartilages in the aryepiglottic folds, anterosuperior to corniculate (strengthening function)
        - Epiglottic (elastic fibrocartilage)
            - Projects upwards behind the tongue
            - Connected to the arytenoids by the aryepiglottic folds
                - Connected to tongue by median and lateral glossoepiglottic folds

    - Associated membranes
        
        Two important intrinsic membranes:
        
        - Quadrangular membrane
            - Extends from the epiglottic to the arytenoid (contains corniculate and cuneiform cartilages)
                - Upper edge - aryepiglottic fold
                - Lower edge - vestibular fold
                - Rima vestibuli in between
        - Cricothyroid ligament
            - Medial part: medial cricothyroid ligament (conus elasticus)
                - From upper border of cricothyroid
            - Lateral part: lateral cricothyroid ligament (triangular membrane; cricovocal membrane)
                - Projects from upper border of cricoid to posterior thyroid cartilage and vocal process of arytenoid
                - Upper border is free → forms cricovocal ligament
                    - Vocal folds consist of this ligament + membranous covering
                - Some fibres of thyroarytenoid form the vocalis muscle

    - Nerve supply of larynx
        - Motor (via nucleus ambiguous of vagus)
            - Most muscles supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve
                - R recurrent laryngeal nerve loops under the R subclavian artery
                - L recurrent laryngeal nerve loops under the aortic arch
                - Both nerves pass upward in the neck within tracheoesophageal groove
                    - Enter pharynx under the lower border of inferior constrictor
            - Cricothyroid is innervated by the external laryngeal nerve (branch of superior laryngeal nerve from the vagus)
        - Sensory (cell bodies in inferior vagal ganglion)
            - Above vocal folds
                - Internal laryngeal nerve (sensory only) → branch of superior laryngeal
            - Below vocal folds
                - Recurrent laryngeal nerve
        - PSNS
            - With sensory nerves (cell bodies in dorsal vagal nucleus)
        - SNS (runs with arteries)
            - Superior cervical ganglion → superior thyroid artery → superior laryngeal
            - Middle cervical ganglion → inferior thyroid artery → inferior laryngeal
    - Lymph drainage of larynx
        - Lymph drainage runs with the arterial supply
            - Superior thyroid → upper deep cervical
            - Inferior thyroid → lower deep cervical
            - Thyroid ima artery → pretracheal
    - Blood supply of larynx and venous drainage
        - Blood supply
            - Above the vocal cords
                - Superior laryngeal artery (from superior thyroid from external carotid)
            - Below vocal cords
                - Inferior laryngeal artery (from inferior thyroid from thyrocervical trunk from subclavian)
            - These arteries enter the piriform recess, anastomose and supply the pharynx before entering the larynx
                - No anastomosis in larynx (complete watershed area)

- How is voice produced?
    - Cricovocal (or cricothyroid) ligament is pulled up by the vocalis muscle so that the folds contact one another below the vocal cord
        - Vibration of the cords produce sound
    - Sound depends on:
        - Length, tension and mass of vocal folds
        - Intensity of expired air
        - Shape and volume of resonating chambers
        - Articulation → mouth, tongue, lips, teeth
- Histology of the larynx (mucosa)
    - Most of the larynx is covered by respiratory epithelium (pseudostratified columnar epithelium with cilia)
    - Exceptions
        - Vocal folds → stratified squamous
        - Anterior surface of epiglottis → stratified squamous epithelium with mucous glands
    - Note:
        - Laryngeal saccule contains abundant mucous glands
        - Lamina propria is loose throughout but tight at vocal folds
            - Swelling tends to accumulate above glottis (cannot disperse over glottis)
