# Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

## Case Protocol 10 â€“ **Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm**

*An 81-year-old man was brought by ambulance to the Emergency Department with severe back pain. The pain had been intermittent for six days but had become increasingly severe in the past four hours. He had a history of myocardial infarction six years previously and a strong family history of ischaemic heart disease. He was also suffering from hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and gout. There was no history of gastrointestinal, renal or hepato-biliary disease.*

*Examination revealed a distressed, pale old man with ankle oedema. There was an **expansile, pulsating mass 6 cm in diameter**, in the epigastrium. A **systolic bruit was audible over the mass** as well as over the femoral arteries. There was mild cardiomegaly, an S3 gallop rhythm and his chest was clear.*

- Monitoring AAA
    - Size is the most important factor when deciding monitoring or management

        - Aneurysm = 1.5x normal diameter
    - For infrarenal
        - Small aneurysm (< 4.4cm) - FU with U/S in 6 months (less frequent if smaller))
        - 4.5-4.9cm (significant) - FU with US in 3 months
        - â‰¥ 5cm (large) - refer to vascular surgeon (urgent)

    - True aneurysm - localised dilatation of **ALL 3 LAYERS** of BV/cardiac wall due to pathological weakening

    - possible sequelae from AAA â†’ gangrene or amputation w/o treatment
    - Causes
        - Embolism from mural thrombus in AAA
            - Thrombus likely due to endothelial disruption or dysfunction + turbulent flow

            - Rupture or erosion with overlying thrombus and haemorrhage into plaque
- PVD - 6 Pâ€™s
    - Pain: absent in some due to prompt anaesthesia and paralysis
    - Pallor - within a few hours becomes mottled cyanosis
    - Pulselessness
    - Paraesthesias: light touch lost first (small fibres), then sensory modalities
    - Perishingly cold
    - Paralysis (most important, heralds impending gangrene)

Case Protocol questions not answered directly by notes written above 

- Q2. b. What would be the appropriate pharmacological treatment options for his HTN and hypercholeterolaemia?
    - HTN
        
        Drugs indicated if:
        
        1. High CVD risk (>15%)
        2. Moderate risk + BP>160/100 OR premature CVD FHx OR ATSI
        3. Low risk (<10%) + BP>160/100 
        
        Effective combinations: 
        
        - ACE-I/ARB + CCB/Thiazide/BBlocker
        - BBlocker + dihydropyridine CCB
        - Thiazide + CCB/BBlocker
        
        Use w/ care combinations: 
        
        - Dilitiazem + BBlocker = heart block risk
        - ACE-I/ARB + K+sparing diuretic = hyperK risk
        
        Avoid combinations:
        
        - ACE-I + ARB = increased renal dysfunction risk
        - Verapamil + BBlocket = heart block risk
        
    - hyperchol
        
        Drugs indications: 
        
        secondary CVD prevention needed (â†’ intensive therapy) 
        
        primary CVD prevention in high absolute CVD risk px (esp. very high lipids OR multiple RFs)
        
        priority: focus on predominant lipid disorder (hyperchol/hypertriglyceridaemia/combined hyperlipidaemia)
        
        Statins: 
        
        - first-line (reduce LDL chol and CVD risk)
        - supplementary ezetimibe (only used alone if px statin intolerant)
        - statin SEs (esp. muscle sx and new onset DM) do not detract from its benefits
        
        Other drugs: 
        
        Evolocumab (subsidised for aussie pxs w/ familial hyperchol and LDL not well controlled w/ max dose statin or ezetimibe OR statin CI)
        
        Fenofibrate - reduce triglycerides + CV risk in T2DM pxs w/ elevated triglycerides + low HDL 
        
- Q5.  If the patient developed a painful, pale leg with absent peripheral pulses in that limb, what would be the most likely explanation? Describe the sequence of events resulting in this complication.

    1. Hypovolaemic shock 

***Surgical intervention was attempted, but the patient died intra-operatively.***

- Q7. Would a post-mortem examination be necessary prior to writing a death certificate?
    
    Death is reasonably expected outcome so you do not need a refferal for m=post mortem exam for a death certificate. 
    
    If its within 24 hours of an operation (anaesthetic) need referal for coronors exam â€”> THIS RULEIS NOT TRUE ANYMORE.  
    

How do you issue a death certificate? 

## Memorandum: AAA (anatomy)

- Blood supply of the abdomen
    - Abdominal aorta is a continuation of the thoracic aorta from the aortic hiatus (T12)
        - Descends in the abdomen anterior to the vertebral bodies
            - Bifurcates at L4, slightly to the left of the midline, into R and L common iliac arteries
    - Three main branches supply most of the abdominal viscera
        - Coeliac trunk (T12/L1) â†’ foregut (abdominal oesophagus to greater duodenal papilla)
        - SMA (L1) â†’ midgut (greater duodenal papilla to proximal 2/3 of transverse colon)
        - IMA (L3) â†’ hindgut (distal 1/3 of TC to midway along anal canal)
    - In addition to these main branches, the abdominal aorta also gives off:
        - Inferior phrenic arteries
        - Middle suprarenal arteries
        - Renal arteries
        - Gonadal arteries
        - Lumbar arteries

            - Hepatic artery proper
                - Divides into R and L hepatic arteries

- Venous drainage of the abdomen (and portal system)
    - Venous drainage of the anterior abdominal viscera, except the inferior part of the rectum, is through the portal system
        - Portal vein â€”> hepatic sinusoids â€”> hepatic veins â€”> IVC
    - Portal vein
        - Final common pathway for the transport of venous blood from the spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and abdominal part of GIT
        - Formed by splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein posterior to the neck of the pancreas (L2 level)
            - Ascends to the liver, passing posterior to the superior part of the duodenum
                - Enters right margin of the lesser omentum
            - Ascends anterior to epiploic foramen and posterior to both bile duct (right) and hepatic artery proper (left)
            - Divides into right and left branches which enter the liver parenchyma
        - Tributaries
            - Right and left gastric veins
                - Drain lesser curvature and abdominal oesophagus
            - Cystic veins
                - Drain gallbladder
            - Para-umbilical veins
                - Associated with obliterated umbilical vein (ligamentum teres) and connect to veins on the anterior abdominal wall

    - Splenic vein
        - Forms from numerous smaller vessels leaving the hilum of the spleen
            - Passes to the right, through splenorenal ligament (with splenic artery and tail of the pancreas)
        - Tributaries
            - Short gastric veins
                - Drain fundus and left part of greater curvature of the stomach
            - Left gastro-epiploic vein
                - Drain greater curvature of the stomach
            - Pancreatic veins
                - Drain body and tail of the pancreas
            - Inferior mesenteric vein (usually)
                - Drains splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon and superior part of the rectum
                - Begins as superior rectal vein and ascends â€”> receives sigmoid veins and left colic vein
                    - Occasionally ends at the junction of the splenic and SMV or joins the SMV
    - Superior mesenteric vein
        - Drains blood from the small intestine, caecum, ascending colon and transverse colon
        - Begins in the right iliac fossa as veins draining the terminal ileum, caecum and appendix join
            - Ascends in the mesentery to the right of SMA
        - Tributaries
            - Right gastro-epiploic vein
                - Drains right part of the greater curvature of the stomach
            - Anterior and posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal veins
                - AIPV usually drains into right gastro-epiploic vein
                - PIPV usually empties directly into the portal vein
            - Jejunal and ileal veins
            - Ileocolic, right colic and middle colic veins
    - Portosystemic anastomoses
        - Largest collateral channels between portal venous and systemic venous system include
            - Gastro-oesophageal junction around cardia
                - Left gastric vein and tributaries form a portosystemic anastomosis with tributaries of the azygos system of veins
            - Anus
                - Superior rectal vein anastomoses with middle and inferior rectal veins
            - Anterior abdominal wall around umbilicus
                - Para-umbilical veins anastomose with veins of the anterior abdominal wall
        - Portal hypertension leads to enlarged veins (varices) at these sites
