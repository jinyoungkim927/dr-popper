# Endometrial and Cervical Cancer (Anat)

## Case Protocol 2 - **Endometrial Cancer**

*An obese 56-year-old woman with long-standing type 2 diabetes presented to her gynaecologist with **PV bleeding** which alarmed her because she had been menopausal for six years. During that time, she had regular Pap smear screening, which had never shown any abnormalities. She had taken hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for several years but had ceased three years ago. There were no other symptoms, and no abnormalities were detected on physical examination. Specifically, the involuted uterus was of normal size, and the cervix was mobile.*

    - Vag bleeding after 12 mths of amenorrhoea at an age where menopause can be expected
        - Common (5% of all gynae outpxs)
        - Red flag symptom! Treat as malignancy until proven otherwise
            - Refer to gynaecologist for an appointment within 2 weeks
    - Causes of post-menopausal bleeding
        - Most common

            📌
            
            Note: **Pap smear** is **not appropriate** as it cannot diagnose endometrial cancer accurately (but can incidentally find cervical involvement?)

        - Can predict need for biopsy in post-menopausal women
    - Normal endometrial thickness is < 4mm
        - Endometrial Ca can be excluded in post-menopausal women in the presence of a thin homogenous endometrium
        - NPV = 98%
    - > 4 mm = > 7.3% likelihood of endometrial Ca

- A histopathological section of tissue obtained by endometrial biopsy was reported as showing a well- differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma. What factors are likely to influence this woman’s prognosis?
    - Staging grading
        - Grade: **A description of a tumor based on how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer cells are likely to grow and spread**
            - Grade 1- well differntiatied
            - Grade 2- les than 50% solid areas
            - Graide 3: serous or ____ clear cell?? didnt get teh rest of this
        - Stage: TNM : guides how far its spread  (invasion → ? is that T or whatd he say)
            - Tumour :size and extent
            - Nodes
            - Mets
            - 
        - Metastasis
    - subtype  (guides prognosis)
    
    Stage 1: Confided to uterus 
    
    Stqage II: involves corpus adn cervix 
    
    stage III: extended outside the uterus but not outside the true pelvis 
    
    Stage IV: extended outside the true pelvis obviously involved mucosa  of bladder and rectum 
    
- Factors which influence endometrial Ca prognosis
    - Type
        - Type 1: endometroid adenocarcinoma (80% of cases)
            - Associated with oestrogen + poorer prognosis
        - Type 2: serous, clear cell carcinoma (15% of cases)
            - Poorer prognosis
            - Not oestrogen sensitive
    - Grade or differentiation
        - Well differentiated → easily recognisable glandular pattern
        - Moderately differentiated → well-formed glands with solid sheets of malignant cells
        - Poorly differentiated → characterised by solid sheets of cells
            - Few recognisable glands and more nuclear atypia + mitotic activity
    - Stage (FIGO)
        - Based on the FIGO criteria (corresponds to TNM system)
        - Stage 1 (confined to uterine corpus)
        - Stage 2 (uterine corpus + cervix)
        - Stage 3 = regional (outside uterine corpus but not outside true pelvis)
        - Stage 4 = distant (outside true pelvis)
            - Invades bladder or bowel (4A)
            - Distant metastases (4B)
- Natural Hx and spread in endometrial Ca
    
    Endometrial Hyperplasia is the precursor 
    
    - Mechanisms of spread
        - Direct extension
            - Tumour growth to involve the entire endometrial surface
            - Direct myometrial invasion and extension to peri-uterine structures (e.g. vagina, broad ligament)
        - Lymphatic spread
            - Regional LNs (pelvic, para-aortic, inguinal)
        - Haematogenous spread
            - Lungs, bone, liver, adrenals
- Management of endometrial Ca
    - Surgical (first-line in almost all cases)
        - Total abdominal hysterectomy + BSO
    - Radiotherapy and chemotherapy
        - Adjuvant for high-risk patients or for palliation
            - Radiotherapy may be external beam or vaginal brachytherapy
    - Hormonal therapy
        - Progestins
        - Aromatase inhibitors
    - Surveillance
        - Most recurrences are within 3 years
            - Cases tend to be monitored 3 monthly for 2-3 years, then 6 monthly or annually

*A total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal cytology, and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy were performed. Histopathological and cytological assessment determined that the endometrial adenocarcinoma was confined to the wall of the uterine corpus (stage 1B).*

Peritoneal cytology is **a laboratory test that examines cells in peritoneal fluid, which is a fluid found in the abdominal cavity, to detect the presence of cancer cells**. - if you have malignant cells in that washing its concerning that the cancer cells

                - Ureters pass under uterine artery
    - Colon
        - Posterior to uterus (may be perforated)
    - Bladder
        - Anterior to uterus
        - Damage or risk of vesicovaginal fistula
- How to differentiate b/w ureter and artery in surgery
    - Ureters pass posterior to the uterine and ovarian arteries
        - Uterine artery crosses the ureter approximately 1cm lateral to internal os (”water under the bridge”)
    - **Ureter vermiculates (moves in a worm-like manner) whilst arteries are pulsatile**
    - Course of ureter can be traced from the kidney to the bladder

## Past question: **Cervical cancer** (anatomy)

**Case:**

*A forty-seven-year-old premenopausal lady presents to her GP for a pap smear. She has a history of i**ntermenstrual** and **post-coital bleeding** with no bowel or bladder symptoms. On examination, there was a small **ulce**r on the cervix localised to the cervix as well as haemoserous fluid in the vagina. There were no palpable pelvic nodes or paracervical masses.*

- What is Australia’s HPV vaccination program
    - School-based program
        - Recommended for adolescents aged 9-14 years to have 2 doses of nona-valent HPV vaccine
            - 6-12 month interval between doses
        - If ≥ 15 years, give 3 doses with an interval of 2 months (dose 1 and 2) and 4 months between dose 2 and 3
    - 9-valent vaccine protects against over 90% of cervical cancer
        - 16 and 18 + 5 additional (31, 33, 45, 52, 58)
- Pathophysiology of cervical Ca development
    - Formation of transformation zone (squamo-columnar junction) due to cyclical exposure of the distal endocervical epithelium to the acidic vaginal environment under hormonal influence
        - Induces dysplasia
    - Infection of metaplastic epithelium at cervical transformation zone with a oncogenic HPV strain
    - Persistent infection (note majority of infections are self-resolving)
    - Development of pre-cancerous lesions (in-situ) → malignant change
        - Viral E6 and E7 genes bind Rb (tumour suppressor) and p53 which inactivates them
    - Further mutations allows the carcinoma to invade the basement membrane
- Management of cervical Ca
    - Surgical
        - Large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) [if insitu]

- Describe the normal menstrual cycle
    - Follicular phase (days 1-14)
        - Hormones
            - Slow rise in FSH → selects follicle with most FSH receptors
            - Slow rise in oestrogen (increased granulosa cells)
        - Histology
            - Primordial follicles mature to primary and secondary follicles (over 2 months)
                - One secondary follicle is selected with each menstrual cycle → becomes a mature Graafian follicle
                - Other secondary follicles undergo atresia
        - Uterus
            - Menses
                - Shedding of endometrium due to contraction of spiral arteries and ischaemia) begins the follicular phase
            - Proliferative stage
                - Proliferation of endometrium under oestrogen influence
    - Ovulation (day 14)
        - LH surge triggers rupture of Graafian follicle and release of oocyte and corona radiata cells
    - Luteal phase **(day 14-28 → fixed)**
        - Hormones
            - Rise in progesterone > oestrogen (due to corpus luteum)
        - Histology
            - Ruptured follicle forms corpus luteum and secretes progesterone
                - Needs B-hCG (secreted by placenta) to maintain endometrial viability
            - Corpus luteum undergoes atresia → corpus albicans
        - Uterus
            - Secretory stage
                - Progesterone influence maintains endometrium (vascular via spiral arteries)
