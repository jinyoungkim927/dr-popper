# Hernias and Bowel Obstruction (Anat)

## Past Question: **Femoral hernia** (anatomy)

**Case:** *A 55-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the ED. He is complaining of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. His abdomen is soft, non-distended with a lump that “does not go away’’ in the inguinal region. He has guarding to upper and lower abdomen with palpation. He has a history of diabetes.*

                - Peritoneal viscus may enter the scrotum
            - Direct (often acquired, related to older age)

        - Hernia examination
            - Assess patient whilst standing (and then supine)
            - Determine whether:
                - Unilateral or bilateral
                - Reducible or incarcerated
                - Painful (suggests strangulation)
            - Cough impulse test
                - Place fingers over hernia site and ask patient to cough. Impulse should be palpable
            - Ring occlusion test
                - Reduce hernia (or ask patient to reduce → sometimes with standing)
                - Occlude the deep inguinal ring from the outside (midpoint)
                    - Ask patient to cough or tense intra-abdominal muscles
                    - If hernia reappears, it is travelling through the inguinal triangle (direct) and not the canal

            - May identify faecal impaction or rectal mass as a cause of obstruction
            - Blood may indicate tumour, ischaemia, intussusception
- Investigative approach to hernia (and bowel obstruction)
    - Hernia is often a clinical diagnosis

        - Expectant management
            - Serial investigations for signs of any clinical deterioration → surgery
            - Gastrografin (hypertonic, water soluble contrast)
                - Increases osmotic load - decreases wall oedema
- How can a bowel obstruction lead to shock
