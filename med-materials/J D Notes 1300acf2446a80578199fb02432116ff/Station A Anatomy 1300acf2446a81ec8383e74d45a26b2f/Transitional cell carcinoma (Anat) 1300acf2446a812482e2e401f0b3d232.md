    - Malignant tumour arising from the transitional epithelium
        - May be renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, proximal 2/3 of urethra

        - Variable and non-specific
            - Haematuria (most common PC)
                - Classically painless and throughout micturition (suggests higher source)
                - High clinical suspicion in unexplained haematuria in patient > 40
            - Urinary symptoms (irritative)
                - Frequency, dysuria
        - Less common symptoms
            - Obstructive symptoms (retention, hesitancy, straining, poor stream)
            - Flank pain (if renal pelvis involved)
        - If advanced disease
            - Systemic symptoms (weight loss, fatigue)
            - Signs of metastases

- Management of urothelial bladder Ca
    - Depends on patient and disease factors
    - Low grade, does not invade muscle
        - Surgery
            - TURBT (transurethral resection of bladder tumour for low stage lesions)

    - Consider involvement of palliative care
- Mechanism of spread from urinary bladder + complications
    - Local invasion (prostate, uterus, vagina, rectum, kidneys, bowel)
        - Increased risk of recurrence
        - Needs more invasive surgery (e.g. radical cystectomy with muscle invasion)
        - Complications

        - Liver, bone, brain, adrenals
    - Note: urothelial tumours exhibit **polychronotropism**
        - Tendency to recur over time in new locations in urothelial cells → may be due to tumour cell shedding

- Nerve supply of urinary bladder
    - Nerve supply via inferior hypogastric plexus
    - SNS
        - L1-L2 cell body → sympathetic trunk → lumbar and sacral splanchnic nerve → superior and inferior hypogastric plexus
        - Vasomotor function
            - **Relaxes detrusor muscle and promotes urine retention**
            - Contracts internal urethral sphincter
    - PSNS
        - Cell bodies (S2-4) → pelvic splanchnic nerves
        - Function
            - Contracts detrusor muscle (stimulates micturition)
    - Sensory afferents in bladder wall senses bladder fullness
        - Signals the need to urinate → stretch reflex able to be overcome by higher centres
    - Note: pudendal nerve provides voluntary control over micturition (external urethral sphincter)
- Lymph drainage of urinary bladder
    - Follows arterial supply to external and internal iliac LNs → common iliac LNs → cisterna chyli → thoracic duct
