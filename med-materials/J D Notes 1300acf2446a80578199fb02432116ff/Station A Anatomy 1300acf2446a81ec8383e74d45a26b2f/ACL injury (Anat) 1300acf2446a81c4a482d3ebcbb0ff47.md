# ACL injury (Anat)

*A 27-year-old female presents to ED following an injury during a football game. He twisted his right knee and heard a pop. On examination, the patient could weight bear but the knee felt unstable and it was tender and swollen. Lachman’s test, the anterior drawer and pivot shift were positive.*

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: ACL injury (pop, twisting mechanism, haemarthrosis)
    - DDx for acutely swollen knee (mechanism dependent)
        - Alternative or concomitant ligament tear
            - MCL, LCL, PCL
        - Meniscal injury
            - **Often presents with less swelling**
        - Patella pathology
            - Subluxation or dislocation
            - Tendon tear or fracture
        - Bone contusion or intra-articular fracture
            - Unlikely given usual mechanism of ACL injury
- Explain anterior drawer, Lachman’s test, pivot shift
    - Anterior draw
        - Flex knee to 90 degrees, stabilise foot and pull
    - Lachman’s
        - Place knee in 30 degrees flexion
        - Stabilise the distal femur with one hand and pull the proximal tibia with another
        - Increased anterior translocation with a soft end-point suggests ACL injury
    - Pivot shift test
        - Leg starts extended in internal tibial rotation
        - Apply valgus stress and flex knee
        - Clunking sensation is positive
- Mechanism of injury for ACL
    - Can occur secondary to low- or high-energy mechanisms
        - Low energy/non-contact (more common)
            - Planted foot + pivoting action (e.g. changing direction)
            - High valgus stress on knee
        - High energy
            - Direct blows to the knee causing forced hyperextension and/or imparting a valgus force on the knee
    - Patients often describe a ‘pop’ before onset of symptoms
        - Often significant swelling is associated (haemarthrosis)
        - May be able to weight bear but ‘feels unstable’
- Grading ACL sprains
    1. Ligament mildly damaged
        1. Slightly stretched but still able to keep the knee joint stable
    2. Ligament partially torn 
        1. Stretched to the point where it is now loose
    3. Ligament completely torn 
        1. Knee joint unstable
- Investigative approach to ACL
    - Definitive diagnosis:
        - Imaging (MRI preferred)
        - **Knee arthroscopy (invasive)**
    - Ancillary
        - Clinical exam and history can be highly suggestive
        - **Orthogonal X-rays (AP, lateral, merchant/skyline)**
            - Look for effusion (lateral film)
                - Ensure the suprapatellar and prefemoral fat pads are close together
            - Look at main bones
            - Look at tibial plateau (avulsion fracture)
- What is the Ottawa Knee Rule
    - Guides the use of imaging for acute knee injuries
        - If YES to any of the questions, imaging is indicated
    - WAIT, get an X-ray if:
        - Weight-bearing for ≥ 4 steps is not possible
        - Age ≥ 55
        - Inability to flex knee to 90 degrees
        - Tenderness isolated to:
            - Patella OR
            - Head of fibula
- Management of ACL injuries
    - Priorities
        - Manage swelling (limits movement and impairs rehab)
        - Can delay operative management (6 weeks of rehab prior to surgery may improve outcomes)
        - Surgery for those with instability and/or combined ACL + MCL injury
    - Acute management
        - RICE
            - Rest, ice, compression, elevation
        - Avoid weight bearing (esp. if unstable)
            - Use crutches if needed
        - Analgesia (NSAIDs, paracetamol)
    - Choices of management
        - Need for operation depends on:
            - Level of functional demands on knee
            - Complexity of injuries (e.g. multiple structures)
            - Significant instability
            - Patient desire
        - Non-operative management
            - Physiotherapy
        - Operative management
            - Arthroscopic replacement of ACL with graft
                - Patella tendon
                - Hamstring tendon (semitendinosus)
            - Extensive rehabilitation as follow-up
- What other structures are often injured alongside the ACL
    - Around 50% injure secondary structures with an ACL tear
    - Unhappy triad
        - ACL
        - MCL
        - Medial meniscus
            - Fixed to MCL and joint capsule and more vulnerable to tear
- Describe the main structures of the knee joint
    - Knee joint is composed of three articulating bones (femur, tibia, patella) and many supporting ligaments (patellar, MCL, LCL, ACL, PCL)
    - Synovial uniaxial joint (2 components)
        - Tibiofemoral articulation (femoral condyles and tibial plateau)
        - Patellofemoral articulation

    - Menisci
        - C-shaped, fibrocartilaginous wedge shaped cartilage attached at both ends to the intercondylar area of the tibia
            - Thick externally and thin internally
        - The medial meniscus is less mobile whilst the lateral meniscus is more mobile (no extra attachments as popliteus tendon separates it from LCL)

            - Deepen the concavity of the tibial plateau for articulation with the femoral condyles
                - More stability
            - More surface area = better shock absorption and weight distribution

- In a lateral injury of the knee, what nerve are you worried about and examination findings
    - Common fibular nerve (course, supply, lesion)
        - Origin
            - L4-S2 anterior rami
        - Course
            - Branch of the sciatic nerve (branch of lumbosacral)
                - Descends into the posterior compartment of thigh, below piriformis
                - Bifurcates into tibial and common peroneal nerve proximal to knee joint
                    - Enters popliteral fossa
            - Common fibular nerve follows the border of the biceps femoris in a lateral and inferior direction
            - Enters the lateral compartment of leg by wrapping around the neck of the fibula
                - Passes between attachments of fibularis longus to divide into superficial and deep fibular nerves
            - Terminal branches
                - Superficial fibular nerve (lateral)
                    - Fibularis longus, brevis (eversion)

        - Findings on examination
            - Inability to dorsiflex foot (e.g. footdrop)
                - High-stepping gait
            - Inability to evert foot
                - Foot is inverted and plantar flexed at rest
            - Loss of sensation over dorsum of foot and lateral leg

- Explain the mechanism of unlocking the knee
    - Locking the knee minimises energy expenditure (via muscle contraction) when standing
    - Enablers
        - Congruent articular surface
            - Larger lateral femoral condyle contributes to medial rotation of the femur after the medial femoral condyle is already congruent with the medial tibial meniscus
        - Tight ligaments
            - Iliotibial band
            - Collaterals
            - PCL
            - Oblique and arcuate popliteral ligaments
    - Unlocking the knee
        - Popliteal muscle contracts and causes internal rotation of the tibia (same outcome as external rotation of femur

- What is Segond’s fracture
    - Avulsion fracture of the lateral aspect of tibial plateau or lateral tibial condyle
    - Usually results from excessive internal rotation and varus stress resulting in increased stress on the LCL
- Compartments of the leg
    
    ![Musclecompartmentsoftheleg.jpg](ACL%20injury%20(Anat)%201300acf2446a81c4a482d3ebcbb0ff47/Musclecompartmentsoftheleg.jpg)
    
- Causes of patella displacement
    - Lateral displacement is most common
        - More common in women due to larger Q angle (angle between femur and tibia)
            - Assessed by drawing a line from the ASIS to the middle of patella and extrapolating a line from middle of patella and tibial tuberosity
            - Wider in women due to wider pelvis
    - Limiters of dislocation
        - Medial pull of vastus medialis
        - Anterior projection of lateral femoral condule and deeper slope for lateral patellar facet mechanically deters dislocation
- Anatomical basis of unhappy triad
    - Ligament tears are most common when a force is applied to the knee when the foot is planted
        - MCL and LCL often tight when leg is extended to minimise lateral disruption
    - MCL is attached firmly to medial meniscus
        - Hence, MCL tear often tears the meniscus
            - Due to a blow to the lateral side of the extended knee; OR excessive twisting of the flexed knee which disrupts the MCL and tears or detaches meniscus from joint capsule
            - Medial menisci injury detected with medial rotation of tibia on femur
        - Lateral meniscus does not usually tear due to its mobility
            - Detected by pain on lateral rotation of tibia on femur

    - Management of meniscal injuries
        - Peripheral tears can often be repaired, or may heal on their own due to generous blood supply (in periphery)
            - Can be removed by arthroscopic surgery which can predispose the knee to instability and inflammatory changes
        - Radial is most common and occur within the avascular zone
            - May require arthroscopic meniscectomy
        - Bucket handle tears can cause restriction of knee motion and require more urgent surgery
