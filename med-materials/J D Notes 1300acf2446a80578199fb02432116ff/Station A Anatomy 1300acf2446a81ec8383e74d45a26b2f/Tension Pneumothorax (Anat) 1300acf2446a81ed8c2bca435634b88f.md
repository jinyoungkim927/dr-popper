    - MSK
        - Rib fractures (flail chest —> pain and dyspnoea)
    - Cardiac
        - Haemopericardium —> cardiac tamponade
            - Due to direct trauma to the heart, great vessels, pericardial vessels
            - Beck’s triad: hypotension, venous distension, diminished heart sounds
        - Aortic dissection
        - Aortic rupture
    - GIT
        - Oesophageal perforation
        - Traumatic pancreatitis
    - Consider that symptoms may be secondary to an acute medical event which caused the event

        - Aortic rupture
        - Aortic dissection
    - Distributive
        - Spinal cord trauma
- Approach to hx and exam in traumatic pneumothorax
    - Given the traumatic mechanism, initial assessment would begin with a primary survey
        - Airway
            - Assess airway protection, obstructions
            - Monitor for C-spine precautions
        - Breathing: tracheal deviation (away from pneumothorax), decreased air-entry, decreased chest expansion, hyperresonsant percussion, flail chest segment
        - Circulation
            - HR, BP
            - Cyanosis
            - Signs of SVC obstruction (hypotension, elevated JVP)
        - Disability
            - Evidence of a traumatic brain injury (GCS), address pain and discomfort
        - Exposure (fractures)
    - History
        - HOPC
            - Identify mechanism of injury (bystanders)
            - MIST handover from EMT (mechanism, injury, signs/symptoms, treatment)
            - Characterise symptoms - associated symptoms - precipitating event
        - PMHx
            - Existing medical conditions (?causes for accident)
        - Medications and allergies

        - Pleuritic chest pain
        - Tracheal deviation
        - Hyper-resonance on percussion
        - Onset (sudden)
        - Reduced expansion, breath sounds - dyspnoea
        - Absent vocal resonance
        - X-ray: shows collapse, pneumothorax in pleural space
    - Signs of tension pneumothorax
        - Agitation
        - Increased cyanosis + air hunger
        - Haemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension)
        - Raised JVP and distended neck veins
    - Note: consider pneumothorax even in the absence of a busy trauma bay (may be difficulty to appreciate signs)
- Ix approach for pneumothorax
    - If the patient is haemodynamically unstable and the clinical picture is reasonable for tension pneumothorax, an empirical needle thoracostomy or chest tube without imaging can be conducted
    - Diagnosis - radiological diagnosis
        - Unstable —> bedside ultrasound
            - Lung point (junction between inflated lung and pneumothorax)
            - Absence of lung sliding is suggestive
        - Stable —> upright CXR
            - Hypodense, well demarcated region with no lung markings
    - Ancillary investigations
        - Bedside
            - ECG —> rule out DDx (cardiac causes)
            - eFAST scan
                - Trauma ultrasound to look for free fluid in the peritoneum, pericardium or pleural space
                    - Detects pneumothorax
            - Blood gas
        - Lab
            - FBC (expect normal until compensatory dilution)
            - CRP

            - Coagulation studies (baseline bleeding risk)
            - Blood alcohol level (as MVA)
            - UEC and LFTs (baseline levels, identify end organ damage)
            - Troponin and CK-MB (rule out AMI)
            - Lipase (rule out pancreatitis)
        - Imaging
            - Trauma series of X-rays
            - CT head and C-spine
- Types of pneumothorax
    - Primary
        - Spontaneous
            - Tends to develop secondary to a rupture of a subpleural bleb
            - Risk factors: smoking, Marfan’s syndrome, FHx
                - Tends to affect males, tall, slim
    - Secondary
        - Spontaneous
            - Complication of underlying disease (COPD, cystic fibrosis, asthma, malignancy, pneumonia)
        - Traumatic —> increased risk of tension
            - Aetiology
                - MVA, penetrating wound, blunt trauma causing a fractured rib
                - Iatrogenic (bronchoscopy, surgery)
    - Partial collapse of the lung leads to dyspnoea in a non-tension pneumothorax
        - Any pneumothorax can become tension
    - Pathophysiology of tension pneumothorax
        - Occurs when the pleural defect acts as a one-way valve —> air enters the pleural space but cannot leave
            - Progressive expansion of air (increased pleural pressure) which exceeds venous pressure and decreases venous return to the heart
                - Results in decreased gas exchange and worsening hypoxia
                - Eventually leads to obstructive shock —> cardiac arrest due to inadequate preload
        - Can lead to mediastinal shift and mechanical obstruction of the SVC
- Complications of pneumothorax
    - SVC obstruction due to raised intrapulmonary pressure and mediastinal shift
        - Raised JVP
        - Facial plethora
        - Upper limb oedema
        - Hypotension
        - Positive Pemberton’s sign
        - Swelling of collateral veins
    - Treatment related
        - Damage to great vessels —> haemorrhage
        - Infection
- Management approach
    - Initial management
        - Concurrent assessment and resuscitation (Primary survey → ABCDE)
        - Analgesia as needed
    - Definitive management
        - Needle thoracostomy → chest drain (if emergency)
        - Chest drain
        - For recurrent pneumothorax
            - Consider **talcum** **pleurodesis**
                - Talcum powder inserted into pleural space
                - Aim to fibrose and obliterate the pleural space
- Needle thoracostomy insertion
    1. Perform hand hygiene
    2. Clean skin with antiseptic swab
    3. Local anaesthetic of area (1% lignocaine) if patient conscious and time permitting
    4. Insert a large bore 14-16G cannula
    5. Push the cannula gently through the chest wall until it enters the pleural space
        1. Location: 2nd intercostal space in mid-clavicular line or triangle of safety
            1. Enter above Rib 3 (midpoint of space) to avoid neurovascular bundle in costal groove (never go below rib margin) and collateral bundle above rib
    6. Air will escape through the cannula followed by rapid improvement of clinical status
    7. Keep cannula in situ until a chest drain is inserted
- Chest drain insertion
    - Boundaries of Triangle of Safety
        - Anterior: lateral border of pectoralis major
        - Posterior: lateral border of latissimus dorsi
        - Inferior: 5th intercostal space (Rib 5/6)
            - Count up from T12 or use midshaft of humerus in adducted arm to estimated position
    - Position of chest drain (ant. or post.)
        - Depends on mechanism of injury + patient mobility
            - If penetrating (px not restricted to supine position) → Post.
            - If blunt trauma restricting px to supine position → Ant.
    - Method
        1. Position px supine or 30 deg head up
            1. Arm above and around head (abducted and externally rotated)
        2. Perform hand hygiene
        3. Clean area with chlorhexadine
        4. Place sterile drapes 
        5. Insert local anaesthetic (lignocaine 1%)
        6. Blunt dissection
            1. Make incision following the line of ribs (1-2cm long)
            2. Blunt dissection with finger or blunt forceps
                1. Ensures adherent lung is moved from the insertion site
            3. Load chest drain onto curved forceps and insert into pleural space
                1. Direct anterior and superior to minimise risk of blockage by dependent lung
                2. Ensure all drainage holes are inside the cavity
        7. Seldinger’s technique
            1. Advanced needle with attached syringe (picture thoracocentesis)
                1. Aspirate while advancing (expect fluid for effusion)
            2. Remove the syringe and pass an introducer wire through the cannula
                1. Remove the cannula
            3. Pass dilators over the wire
                1. Ensure all drainage holes are inside the cavity
        8. Attach the tube to the underwater seal drain below the patient’s chest level
            1. Allows air to escape the drain but not to re-enter
            2. Must be placed below patient level or it will siphon back into the cavity
            3. Persistent bubbling of the water suggests ongoing air leak
        9. Watch for ‘swinging’ of the water in the tube connection (with respiration)
        10. Anchor drain, suture and dress wound
        11. Check correct placement with a chest X-ray and resolution of pathology
- Chest drain removal
    1. Hand hygiene
    2. Open dressing pack, add sterile equipment + 0.9% saline
    3. Put on disposable gloves
    4. Remove all dressings around area
    5. Clamp drain tubing (if multiple, clamp all drains before removal)
    6. Remove gloves, perform hand hygiene, wear sterile gloves
    7. Clean w/ antiseptic arnd insertion site + 1-2cm of tubing 
    8. Remove suture securing drain
    9. Instruct px to exhale and hold (if possible). If not, time removal w/ exhalation
    10. Pinch edges of skin together, remove drain using smooth+fast+continuous traction
    11. Seal hole quickly w/ occlusive dressing
    12. Instruct px to breathe normally again
    13. Apply occlusive dressing properly
    14. Dispose equipment
    15. Hand hygiene

Anat

- Blood supply
    - Pulmonary arteries
        - Emerge from RV (pulmonary trunk) and divide
            - Left pulmonary artery (attached to aortic artery by ligamentum arteriosum) → passes over L bronchus
            - Right pulmonary artery → passes anterior to oesophagus, below carina
                - Anterior to R bronchus
    - Bronchial arteries

        - Sends branches along the bronchial tree
    - PSNS: vagus nerve
        - Afferent (inferior vagal ganglion)
            - Pain and cough reflex
        - Efferent (dorsal vagal nucleus)
            - Constricts smooth muscles of bronchi and pulmonary arterioles

    - Passes through the sternal angle anteriorly
        - Marks the position of the anterior articulation of the costal cartilage of rib 2 with the sternum
    - Separates the superior mediastinum from the inferior mediastinum (superior limit of the pericardium)
    - Arch of the aorta begins and ends at this level
    - SVC penetrates the pericardium to enter the heart
        - Azygos vein drains into SVC approximately at this level
    - Tracheal bifurcation into right and left main bronchi
    - Superior limit of the pulmonary trunk
- Neurovascular layer in the chest wall
    - Lie between adjacent ribs and are filled by intercostal muscles
    - Intercostal nerves, arteries and veins lie in the costal groove along the inferior margin of the superior rib
        - Pass in the plane between the inner two layers of intercostal muscles (internal and innermost)
        - Vein is the most superior structure (highest in groove) followed by artery and then nerve
            - The nerve is often not protected by the groove and is the structure most at risk when objects perforate the upper aspect of an intercostal space
        - Small collateral branches of the major intercostal nerves and vessels are often resent superior to the inferior rib below
    - Intercostal nerves
        - Intercostal nerves (anterior rami of spinal nerves T1 - T11)

                - Remaining nine pairs of posterior intercostal arteries
                    - Direct branches of the thoracic aorta
                    - As the aorta is on the left side of the vertebral column, the right posterior intercostal vessels cross the midline anterior to the vertebral bodies and have a longer course
        - Anterior intercostal arteries
            - Originate directly or indirectly as lateral branches of the internal thoracic artery
            - Anterior intercostal arteries which supply the upper 6 spaces arise as direct lateral branches of the internal thoracic
                - Those which supply the lower 6 spaces arise from the musculophrenic artery
            - Anterior intercostals usually have two branches
                - One passes below the margin of the upper rib
                - One passes above the margin of the lower rib and meets a collateral branch of the posterior intercostal artery
        - Note: the distributions of the anterior and posterior intercostal vessels overlap —> can develop anastomotic connections
            - Anterior intercostals are generally smaller than posterior intercostals

            - Pain refers to C3-C5 dermatomes (lateral neck and supraclavicular region of shoulder)
    - Visceral pleura innervated by visceral afferents which accompany the bronchial vessels (pain usually NOT elicited)
- Lung fissures - surface anatomy
    - Right lung
        - Fissures are formed by invaginations of visceral pleura which separate the lobes and allow almost total movement between them
            - Oblique fissure: separates inferior lobe from superior and middle lobe
            - Horizontal fissure: separates superior lobe from middle lobe
        - Oblique fissure
            - A curved line on the thoracic wall from:
                - **T4 spinous process, across 5th intercostal space laterally, along contour of R6 anteriorly**
        - Horizontal fissure
