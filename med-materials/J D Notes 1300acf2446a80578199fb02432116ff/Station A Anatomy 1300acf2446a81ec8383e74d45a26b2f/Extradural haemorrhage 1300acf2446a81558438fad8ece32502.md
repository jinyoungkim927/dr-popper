# Extradural haemorrhage

**Case:** *A 16-year-old boy was brought by ambulance to ED, after being kicked in the right side of the head during a football match one hour previously. The boy was unconscious but quickly regained consciousness on the field. He became increasingly drowsy, and began vomiting several times. ED saw a tender swelling over the right temporal region.*

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: epidural haemorrhage secondary to traumatic fracture and rupture of middle meningeal artery (most common)
        - Likely given the head trauma (temporal swelling), LoC with lucid intervals
    - DDx (raised ICP → drowsiness and vomiting)
        - Other pathologies secondary to head trauma
            - Brain contusion (coup, contracoup)
            - Other intracranial bleeds (subdural, SAH, ICH)
            - Traumatic brain injury → diffuse axonal injury
        - Identify any scalp lacerations, skull fractures, C-spine injuries
        - Mass effect - tumour abscess
- Investigative approach and findings?
    - Concurrent assessment and resuscitation (primary survey → GCS assessment)
    - Principal diagnostic investigation
        - Urgent non-contrast CT brain
        - Can use MRI (if uncertain CT and high clinical suspicion)
    - Ancillary investigations
        - FBC with platelet count (anaemia, thrombocytopaenia prior to surgery)
        - Coags (PT, INR, aPTT prior to surgery)
        - Group and hold (possible transfusion)
        - UEC (hyponatraemia can cause or worsen cerebral oedema)
    - CT findings for epidural haemorrhage
        - Biconvex (lentiform) mass which does not cross suture lines
            - Uniformly hyperdense but can be mixed (swirl sign → active bleeding)
        - Evidence of mass effect
            - Midline shift, sulcal effacement
            - Compression of ventricles and basilar cisterns
            - Cerebral oedema (loss of grey-white differentiation, evidence of herniation)
        - Note: subdural haemorrhage
            - Crescent-shaped mass which is not contained by suture lines
        - Note: old haemorrhage appears hypodense
- Relevance of scalp bruising and tenderness
    - Scalp bruising and tenderness supports an extracranial pathology as opposed to an extradural collection spreading to the scalp via a skull fracture
- Pathophysiological sequence of events in this case
    1. Trauma to head
    2. Fracture to pterion
    3. Laceration or rupture of anterior division of middle meningeal artery
    4. Bleeding into epidural space → LOC, neurological deficits
    5. Growth of haematoma → raised ICP → herniation syndromes
- Pathophysiology of extradural haemorrhage and location
    - Extradural haemorrhages are often of traumatic origin
        - More common in younger patients as they are more likely to partake in risky behaviour
        - Occurs secondary to laceration of relevant vascular structures following a skull fracture
    - Typical location is the pterion (junction of frontal, greater wing of sphenoid, temporal and parietal bones) which are in close proximity
        - The bone in this area is thin and overlies the anterior division of the middle meningeal artery
- Pathophysiology of subdural haemorrhage and location
    - Develops due to shearing of the bridging veins (often after relatively minor trauma)
        - Usually self-limiting as raised ICP compresses the bleeding veins (low pressure)
    - Occurs more commonly in the elderly and alcoholics as cerebral atrophy causes stretching of the veins
- Glasgow Coma Scale
    - Standardised neurological scale, validated in trauma patients, to record the LoC
        - Should be documented regularly (every 15 mins)
    - Interpretation
        - A drop of more than 2 points is significant
        - Severe: 3-8 (usually indicates intubation)
        - Moderate: 9-12
        - Mild: 13-15

- Intracranial pressure and volume
    - Monro-Kellie Doctrine (P-V relationship between CSF volume, brain tissue, blood)
        - States that the cranial compartment is inelastic (fixed) and there must be a volume equilibrium between its constituents
        - Any increase in volume of its constituents (or addition of a new volume) must result in compensatory pressure changes in the other constituents
    - Cerebral perfusion pressure = MAP - ICP
        - Rise in ICP = reduced CPP (ischaemia, infarction, coma, death)
- Herniation and cause of fixed dilated right pupil
    - ICP is normally < 15mmHg in adults
        - Pressure or volume increases in the skull is initially compensated (venous compression, CSF displacement) → raised ICP → displacement of brain tissue (Monro-Kellie) → herniation syndromes
    - Herniation syndromes
        - Cingulate (subfalcine) herniation under falx cerebri
            - Compression of ACA → ischaemic stroke
        - Central or downward transtentorial herniation
            - Caudal displacement of brainstem → Cn III compression (ipsilateral blown pupil)
            - Rupture of paramedian basilar branches → Duret haemorrhages (often fatal)
        - Uncal transtentorial herniation
            - Causal herniation of medial temporal lobe
            - Early → Cn III compresson
                - Ipsilateral fixed pupillary dilation (PSNS fibres on dorsum of Cn III and more vulnerable to compression)
                - Down and out pupil
            - Late → coma
                - Kernohan phenomenon (contralateral blown pupil and ipsilateral hemiparesis)
                    - Due to compression of contralateral cerebral crus (contain corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts) and CnIII against Kernohan notch
        - Cerebellar tonsillar herniation
            - Caudal herniation into foramen magnum
            - Compression of cardiorespiratory centres in the medulla → coma and death

- Outcomes if untreated
    - In extradural haemorrhage, outcomes are poor without treatment (mortality extremely high if GCS < 8)
    - Negative prognostic indicators include:
        - Clinical - blown pupil, low GCS, late intervention
        - Radiological - big haematoma, swirl sign, midline shift
    - Expansion of extradural haematoma → raised ICP → death by tonsillar herniation
- Skull base fracture - signs and clinical significance
    - Haemotympanum (purple TM due to blood pooling)
        - Caused by fracture to the petrous part of the temporal bone
    - CSF rhinorrhoea or otorrhoea
        - ‘Halo sign’ when blood and CSF separate when dropped onto paper or linen
        - Caused by fracture of cribriform plate or petrous part of temporal bone
    - Periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes)
        - Caused by anterior fossa fracture
    - Retroauricular or mastoid ecchymosis (Battle sign)
        - Caused by middle fossa fracture
    - Significance: patients need dosing with ceftriaxone (prophylaxis for infection)
- Anatomical and pathological basis for control of ventilation and cardiovascular function
    - Anatomical centres for respiration and cardiovascular control are largely located in the medulla and pons of the brainstem → tonsillar herniation and compression of centres and ischaemia
        - Medulla controls severe reflex actions
            - Coughing, gagging, swallowing, vomiting (brainstem = no associated nausea)
    - Respiration
        - Changes in respiration based on chemoreceptors
        - Respiratory centres located in both the medulla and pons
            - Medulla
                - Dorsal inspiratory centre
                - Ventral expiratory centre
            - Pons
                - Pneumotaxic centre (upper pons) → controls rate and depth of breathing
                - Apneustic centre (lower pons) → stimulates inspiration
                    - Receives inhibitory impulses from pneumotaxis centre and lung stretch reflexes
    - Cardiac
        - Regulated by nuclei in the medulla which control output to SNS and PSNS supply to the heart
            - Cardioinhibitory centre controls the activity of PSNS nerves
            - Vasoconstrictor nuclei control the activity of SNS to vasculature and cardiac myocytes
            - Vasodilator centres control the activity of the vasoconstrictor centres (inhibitory centres)

                - Superior division → SR, LPS
                - Inferior division → somatic (MR, IR, IO) and PSNS (ciliary ganglion)
    - Arrangement of fibres
        - Pupillary fibres lie on the dorsal surface of the nerve trunk
            - Supplied by arteries which supply the sheath and not the main trunk
            - Susceptible to pressure (PCA aneurysm, herniation) but not by infarction of nerve trunk (e.g. diabetes)

        - Down and out pupil (overriding LR and SO)
        - Fixed and dilated pupil and complete ptosis
- Course of trochlear nerve, lesion

        - Nucleus (motor) - located in midbrain at level of inferior colliculus, ventral to cerebral aqueduct
            - Fibres decussate completely in the midbrain
        - Emerges dorsally near the midline, behind the inferior colliculus through the superior medullary velum
            - Wraps around the midbrain and courses along the free margin of tentorium cerebelli
            - Passes between the SCA and PCA arteries
        - Pierces the roof of the cavernous sinus (through arachnoid and dura mater)

    - Lesion
        - Inability to move eye down effectively (vertical diplopia → reading, going down stairs)
        - Extorsion (intorsion effect of trochlear nerve is impaired)
            - Patient tends to tilt head towards opposite shoulder to compensate
- Course of abducens nerve, lesion
    - Course
        - Nucleus in the medial lower pons
            - Facial nerve fibres wrap around the nucleus dorsally and form the facial colliculus
        - Emerges from the pontomedullary junction (lateral to midline)
            - Pierces the arachnoid and dura mater on the clivus → long intradural course before entering cavernous sinus
            - Passes straight forward in sinus, lateral to ICA and reaches medial end of SOF

- Jason underwent neurosurgery but a persistent left hemiparesis was noted three months after the injury. What are the most likely causes for this neurological deficit, and what other complications may develop after a severe head injury? What consequences might ensue from a less severe head injury that presents only with signs of concussion?
    - Causes of neurological deficit
        - Ischaemia secondary to raised ICP
    - Severe complications include:
        - Focal neurological deficits
        - Seizures and/or epilepsy
    - Complications from less significant injury
        - Headaches
        - Neuropsychiatric disturbances (mood, behavioural changes)
        - Deficits in executive function (e.g. impaired focusing, memory dysfunction)
