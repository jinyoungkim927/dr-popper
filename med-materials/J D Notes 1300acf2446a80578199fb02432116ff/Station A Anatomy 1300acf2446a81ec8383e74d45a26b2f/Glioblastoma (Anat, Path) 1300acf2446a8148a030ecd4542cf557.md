# Glioblastoma (Anat, Path)

**Case:** *A 55-year-old man presents after a new onset seizure. His wife witnessed the episode, which involved twitching and weakness of the face that appeared to spread from the upper left limb. He recently had some terrible headaches. He also experienced sensory changes and decreased memory and his wife noted personality changes.*

    - Patient had a focal-onset, motor seizure (unclear level of awareness)
        - Jacksonian march or Jacksonian seizure is one which begins in the primary motor cortex and thus movements spread from one part of the body to another on same side) with increasing muscle involvement
- Investigative approach to seizure/glioblastoma

    A. Left lateral ventricle
    
    B. Vasogenic oedema surrouding the tumour
    
    C. Septum pellucidum
    
    D. Heterogenous ring-enhancing lesion with central necrosis
    
    This is an axial T1-weighted brain MRI with gadolinium contrast
    
    - There is a large heterogenous ring-enhancing lesion with significant vasogenic oedema and associated midline shift in the L frontal lobe. There is sulcal effacement and ventricular compression
        - Heterogenous uptake (concern for central necrosis in rapid growing tumours or infectious lesions)
    - DDx for ring-enhancing cerebral lesions (DR MAGICAL)
        - Demyelinating disease
        - Radiation necrosis or resolving haematoma
        - Metastasis
        - Abscess
        - Glioblastoma
        - Infarct (subacute)

        - Mixed appearance (e.g. hypointense without contrast, heterogenous enhancement with contrast)
    - T2 and T2 FLAIR
        - Hypertension +/- multifocal enhancements
        - Irregular margins
        - Necrotic core
        - Perifocal oedema
- Explain the clinical symptoms and relate to anatomy in this case
    - Given the left-sided motor and sensory changes of face and upper left arm, with cortical signs (memory and personality) → likely R frontoparietal region
        - Motor defects → pre-central gyrus (frontal lobe)
            - Given distribution, likely inferior and lateral portion
        - Sensory defects → post-central gyrus (parietal lobe)
    - Seizure
        - Due to abnormal neuronal electrical discharge with an epileptic focus in the R frontal lobe (altered neuronal properties, synapses, environment)
    - Headache
        - Mass effect leading to compression and traction on pain-sensitive structures in the brain (e.g. meningeal arteries, venous sinuses, dura, cranial nerves)
    - Personality changes and memory (see other card)
- What is glioblastoma
    - A type of astrocytoma (neuroepithelial tumour (glioma)) which arise from supportive tissue of the brain
        - Most common malignant primary CNS cancer and majority of high-grade astrocytoma
        - Rapidly progressive (days-weeks) due to rapid growth and angiogenesis
    - Classified into four separate grades
        - Low grade (I/II) or high grade (III, IV)
        - Grade 1: pilocytic (common in < 20 years old, well-demarcated, cystic)
        - Grade 2: diffuse (common in 20-40 years old, infiltrative)
        - Grade 3: anaplastic (non-homogenous, often with oedema)
        - Grade 4 (glioblastoma)
    - Pathology
        - Poorly defined, heterogenous mass with necrosis and surrounding vasogenic oedema
        - Histology
            - Pleomorphic anaplastic cells which form pseudopalisades due to necrosis or haemorrhage
            - Microvascular proliferation
        - Associated with EGFR mutations and often stain positive for GFAP
- Explain the memory loss and personality change. What structures may be involved?
    - Personality changes
        - Mainly associated with the prefrontal cortex (**ventromedial** and **orbitofrontal**)
        - Linked with the limbic system which helps regulate emotional expression and experience
        - Note:
            - Frontal lobe (general) responsible for executive function (decision making, thought, problem solving), judgement, regulation of emotion, personality
            - **Dorsomedial** prefrontal cortex associated with decision making and reward seeking
    - Memory
        - Different brain regions encode different types of memory
            - Declarative
                - Episodic (personal) → hippocampus and limbic circuits
                    - Hippocampus is important in encoding short-term to long-term declarative memories
                    - Amygdala is important for fear conditioning (emotional associations)
                - Semantic (general) → inferolateral temporal lobe
                - Long-term storage → neocortex
                - Working memory (’short-term’) → prefrontal cortex (**dorsolateral**)
            - Procedural (skills)
                - Basal ganglia, striatum
        - Note: anterograde amnesia = dysfunction of working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex)
            - Hippocampus and mammillary bodies also important in encoding short-term to long-term memories
- Describe the limbic system and Papez circuit?
    - Papez circuit
        - A model which described how a sensory experience is transformed into an emotional experience (affect) and emotional expression (behavioural, autonomic)
        1. Sensory stimulus arrives from **periphery** and is processed by the **thalamus** and sent to **cortex**
        2. **Cortex** processes sensory information (e.g. somatosensory - parietal, visual - occipital) 
        3. **Cingulate gyrus** collects information from different parts of the cortex and sends information to the **hippocampus** 
            - Travels via **cingulum** (white matter tract) → **parahippocampal gyrus** → **entorhinal cortex** → **subiculum**
        4. Travels to l**ateral and medial mammillary nuclei of hypothalamus** via the **fornix** 
            - **Mediates emotional expression (physiological response)**
        5. Returns via **mammillothalamic tract** to **anterior thalamic nuclei** to **internal capsule** to **cingulate gyrus** to **cortex**
            - **Mediates emotional experience**

            - Formation of memory (in association with emotions)
            - Motivation pathways (reward, punishment)
            - Attention
        - Differences with the Papez circuit
            - Decreased importance of the hippocampus in emotional experience (more of a memory role)

- Prognosis of glioblastoma? How would you manage this patient?
    - Prognosis is unfavourable → medial survival of 12-15 months due to rapid growth and short disease course
    - Management principles
        - Supportive management of raised ICP and cerebral oedema
            - Glucocorticoids (dexamethasone)
            - Mannitol (osmotherapy)
            - Control of BP, BSL, electrolutes
            - Drainage of CSF as needed
        - Symptomatic management of seizures
            - Carbamazepine (focal)

            - Radiotherapy
            - Chemotherapy (temozolomide → oral alkylating agent)

- Causes of death
    - due to increased pressure in the cranial cavity, the cerebellar tonsils can be forced through the foramen magnum.
        - these will compress the lower part of the brain stem and upper cervical cord. in particular, you are worried about the cardiorespiratory centres present in the medulla and brainstem → leading to death
    - herniation → cardioresp failure → death
    - die following a seizure
    - haemorrhage into the tumour
    - invasion of brainstem by tumour
- Anatomy of arachnoid spaces
    - Naturally occurring fluid-filled space
        - The arachnoid mater clings to the inner surface of the dura mater and does not follow the contour of the brain (unlike pia mater)
    - Contains CSF and blood vessels which surround the brain and spinal cord
        - Occasionally enlarges into expanded areas (subarachnoid cisterns)
    - CSF is produced by the choroid plexus (primarily in ventricles)
