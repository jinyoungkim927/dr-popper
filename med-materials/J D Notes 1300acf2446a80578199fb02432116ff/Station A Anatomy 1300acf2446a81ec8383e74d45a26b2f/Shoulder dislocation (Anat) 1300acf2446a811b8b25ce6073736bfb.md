# Shoulder dislocation (Anat)

*A 23-year-old man fell on an outstretched arm during a rugby game. On examination his arms were asymmetrical, swollen and erythematous. His arm was externally rotated and the head of humerus was not palpable in the joint.  There was also loss of sensation in the upper lateral arm.*

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: shoulder dislocation
        - Likely anterior (most prevalent) and given mechanism of injury, inability to palpate head of humerus
        - Possible axillary nerve injury
    - DDx:
        - Subluxation
        - Proximal fracture of the humeral head
        - Soft tissue injury (rotator injury, soft tissue contusion)
        - Acromioclavicular joint separation
    - Predisposing factors (if relevant)
        - Previous dislocation of shoulder
        - Loose joint capsule
        - Damage to glenohumeral ligament
        - Damage to rotator cuff muscles
- Investigative approach to shoulder dislocation → how to interpret imaging
    - Principal diagnostic investigations
        - Orthogonal X-ray views (perpendicular to one another)
            - **Rule out fractures, confirm dislocation and reduction**
            - AP view
            - Axillary view (with arm abducted)
                - Sometimes not possible due to pain
                - Can do Velpeau view → useful in posterior shoulder dislocation
            - Scapular (Y) view - lateral view)
                - Y formed by the body, spine and coracoid process of scapula
                    - Glenoid should be at the centre of the Y
                    - Useful to distinguish anterior and posterior dislocation
                - Loss of communication between joint surfaces = dislocation (subluxation continues to have some contact)
    - Ancillary (surgical planning)
        - CT for bony structures
        - MRI for soft tissue damage (e.g. Bankart, injury to labrum)

- What fractures may be associated with shoulder dislocation
    - Fractures commonly associated with dislocation
        - Hill-Sachs deformity (30-40%)
            - Cortical depression of humeral head following impaction on the glenoid
        - Bankart lesion (soft or bony)
            - Damage to the anteroinferior glenoid labrum following impaction by the humeral head
                - Interrupts the integrity of the joint capsule
            - Bony bankart = fracture of anteroinferior glenoid cavity of scapula bone
        - Avulsion fracture of the greater tubercle

- What direction does dislocation normally occur
    - Structure of the shoulder joint contributes to the direction of dislocation
        - Anterior (95-97%)
            - e.g. blow to abducted, externally rotated, extended arm (blocking a basketball shot))
            - Most commonly due to:
                - Laxity of ligament and capsule anteroinferiorly (allows for abduction)
                - Capsule is strengthened in all other directions by muscle and ligaments
        - Posterior (2-4%)
            - e.g. blow to anterior shoulder or violent muscle contractions (e.g. electrocution, seizure)
                - Mostly supported by rotator cuff muscles and scapula
            - In shock, all muscles are activated at the same time and internal rotators > external rotators (hence posterior dislocation)
        - Inferior (0.5%)
            - Falling and grabbing something (excess abduction)
        - Superior is rare due to AC ligament and tendons of rotator cuff

- Why is the shoulder joint unstable
    - Static
        - Shallow glenoid fossa relative to size of humeral head
    - Dynamic
        - Stabilised by muscles of rotator cuff rather than more stable ligaments or cartilaginous processes seen in other joints
- Describe the anatomy of the shoulder joint (static + dynamic stabilisers)
    - General anatomy
        - Shoulder joint (glenohumeral joint) is a ball and socket joint between the glenoid fossa of the scapula and the head of the humerus
            - Covered by hyaline cartilage
        - Synovial membrane lines the margins of the articular surface and fibrous membrane of the joint capsule
            - Membrane is loose inferiorly to allow for abduction
            - Fibrous capsule attaches to the margins of the glenoid fossa and anatomical neck of the humerus
        - Movements of the joint include:
            - Flexion and extension
            - Abduction and adduction
            - Medial and lateral rotation
            - Circumduction
    - Stabilisers
        - The shoulder has high mobility at the cost of stability (due to a shallow glenoid fossa relative to the size of the head of humerus)
        - Static stabilisers
            - Glenoid labrum
                - Fibrocartilaginous collar which attaches to the margins of the glenoid fossa and deepens it
            - Ligaments (see other card) → glenohumeral, coracohumeral, coracoacromial
        - Dynamic stabilisers
            - Rotator cuff muscles (see other card)
            - Long head of biceps brachii
                - Continuous with the glenoid labrum and connects to supraglenoid tubercle

- How do you manage a shoulder dislocation?
    - Prompt reduction in ED with appropriate sedation and analgesia
        - May not need analgesia if recent, recurrent or non-traumatic
            - Use techniques without significant traction (e.g. external rotation, scapular manipulation, Milch technique)
    - Assessment
        - Neurovascular examination (distal pulses and axillary nerve function)
    - Techniques
        - **Scapular manipulation**
            - **If unsuccessful → external rotation and add Milch technique as needed**
        - Last line: traction-countertraction or Stimson technique
        - Successful if a “clunk” due to humeral head relocation and return of normal shoulder contour is achieved
    - Follow-up with a period of immobilisation (e.g. 6 weeks) for adequate capsular healing
