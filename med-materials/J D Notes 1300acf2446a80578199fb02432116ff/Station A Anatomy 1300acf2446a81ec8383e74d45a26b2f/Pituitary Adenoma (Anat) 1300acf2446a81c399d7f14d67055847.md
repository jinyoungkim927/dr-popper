# Pituitary Adenoma (Anat)

## Case Protocol 41 – **Acromegaly**

**Case:** *A 42-year-old woman was referred to the Endocrinology Clinic with suspected acromegaly. The patient had noticed gradually worsening **bifrontal headache** for the past six months. There were **no visual disturbances**. The patient had also noticed changes in her physical appearance especially **enlargement of her hands and feet**. There was a history of **arthralgia in the knees**, a feeling of increasing **lethargy and tiredness**, and of **nocturia**.*

*Physical examination revealed a woman with coarse facial features, enlargement of her jaw and tongue and a small goitre. Her **hands were large and spade-like**, **blood pressure was 140/100**. There was cardiomegaly and evidence of median nerve compression in the right hand. Crepitus was present in both knees. There was proximal muscle weakness in the upper and lower limbs. The remainder of the neurological examination was normal. The ocular fundus revealed no evidence of papilloedema, and visual fields examination was normal.*

**Alternative stem:**

*A 47-year-old post-menopausal woman presents with worsening headaches, blurry vision, increasing thirst, tiredness & weight gain of 10kg over 6-8 weeks.*

- PDx and DDx
    - PDx: acromegaly 2’ to pituitary adenoma
        - Worsening bifrontal headache: mass effect
        - If blurry vision - compression of cranial nerves (Cn III PSNS, diplopia)
        - Increasing thirst - central DI?
    - DDx
        - Vascular
            - Carotid aneurysm or AComm aneurysm
        - Neoplastic
            - Craniopharyngioma (neoplasm of Rathke’s pouch) → mass effect and often in childhood (5-15) or adults (50-75)
            - Meningioma (most prevalent intracranial tumour)
            - Glioma
            - Metastases
            - Pituitary apoplexy (typically with tumour + spontaneous haemorrhage → infarction and swelling)
        - Rathke’s pouch cyst
        - Trauma
- Ix approach to acromegaly and pituitary adenoma
    - Principal diagnostic Ix for acromegaly
        - IGF-1
            - elevated + clinical manifestations → acromegaly
            - normal → normal
            - mild elevations/unsure → reflex OGTT
        - random GH (baseline) + repeat 2h post-glucose bolus (75g)
            - Failed GH suppression 2’ to glucose load indicates acromegaly
    - Principal diagnostic Ix
        - CT brain contrast → might visualise mass
        - **MRI brain contrast (MRI sella) = gold standard**
            - Ax pituitary mass
            - signs of haemorrhage, necrosis (e.g. apoplexy)
            - Cavernous sinus invasion
        - Screen for other endocrine abnormalities
            - IGF-1 (GH)
            - Morning cortisol/ACTH + 24h urine cortisol
            - TFTs
            - Basal serum prolactin
            - LH/FSH levels
            - oestradiol/testosterone
    - Ancillary
        - Bedside

            - BSL → DM
        - Labs
            - FBC, UEC, LFT (baseline)
        - Other imaging
            - CT Face (preoperative for transsphenoidal surgery)
            - If MRI -ve → look for other sources of ectopic GH (CT CAP)
    - Diagnosis of acromegaly based on:
- Normal physiology of growth hormone and IGF-1
    
    
    GH secretion 
    
    - GHRH (GH releasing hormone)
    - Inhibited by somatomedins (IGF-1, 2) and GH
    - Stress, exercise, hypoglycaemia triggers GH secretion
    
    GH inhibition 
    
    - Somatostatin (GH inhibiting hormone)
    - Stimulated by IGF1, IGF2
    - Hyperglycaemia inhibits GH secretion
    
    Hypothalamus secrete GHRH → ant. pituitary secrete GH → induce IGF-1 synthesis in liver  → serum IGF-1 increase → binds to IGF-1 and insulin receptors 
    
    → stimulate cell growth and proliferation + inhibit apoptosis 
    
    → proliferative effect on bone, cartilage, skeletal m., soft tissue, organs 
    
    → insulin receptor binding → impaired glucose tolerance
    
    → somatostatin secretion from hypothalamus increase → negative feedback → decrease GH and IGF-1
    
- Features of GH secreting adenoma and pathophysiology
    - Tumour mass compression → mass effect Sxs
        - Headache : Raised ICP/compression of nociceptive structures
        - Visual deficits (e.g. bitemporal hemianopia)
        - CN palsies (less likely)
        - Altered release of other pituitary hormones
            - Hypofunction (e.g. hypothyroidism)
            - Hyperprolactinaemia (compression of stalk which impairs dopaminergic inhibition)
    - Related to excess GH
        - Enlargement of bony and soft tissues in response to IGF-1
            - Acral bony overgrowth (GH/IGF-1 after epiphyseal fusion)
                - Increased hand and foot size
                - Frontal bossing
                - Macrognathia
                - Prognathism + gap b/w teeth
            - Pituitary gigantism (in children, due to enlargement prior to epiphyseal fusion)
            - Arthralgia or arthropathy (hypertrophy)
            - Peripheral neuropathy: Soft tissue enlargement (compression) + DM
            - OSA: macrognathia, macroglossia, soft tissue enlargement → airway obstruction
        - Cardiomegaly (HOCM; most common cause of death in acromegaly)
        - Carpal Tunnel syndrome: median n. compression by soft tissue proliferation/hypertrophy
        - Proximal myopathy: m. enlargement → hypermetabolic state → hyperthyroidism
        - CVD (HTN, LVH, cardiomyopathy)
        - Colonic disease
        - Diabetes insipidus (direct effect of pituitary tumour)
        - **Diabetes mellitus**
            - GH→ induces IGF-1 → binds to insulin receptors → insulin resistance
    
- Explain nocturia in pituitary adenoma (two mechanisms)
    
    <aside>
    📌
    
    Normal kidney func. = conc. urine overnight + compensate decreased fluid intake during sleep
    
    Therefore, **True nocturia is always pathological**
    
    </aside>
    
    - 2’ to DM (most likely cause)
        - Hyperglycaemia (d/t insulin resistance + gluconeogenesis) exceeds renal threshold → glycosuria + osmotic diuresis
            - Leads to polyuria + nocturia
            - Loss of water + electrolytes → triggers brain osmoreceptors → polydipsia
    - CDI 2’ to posterior pituitary compression ⇒ impaired ADH secretion (Rarely)
        - Loss of ability to concentrate urine in the collecting duct
    - Dx of DI
        
        ‣ 
        
        - DI can be central (ADH deficiency) or nephrogenic (renal insensitivity)
        - Serum osmolality + urine osmolality + Na level
            - DI: decreased reabsoprtion → increased blood conc. → hypernatraemia
        - Water deprivation test
            - DDx: primary polydipsia
                - In DI, plasma osmolality will stay high but urine osmolality will remain low (decreased H2O reabsorption → dil urine+conc. blood)
            - DDx: CDI and  NDI
                - Administer exogenous desmopressin which corrects urine Osm in CDI but not NDI
- Explain thyroid enlargement in GH adenoma
    - Thyroid hyperplasia is common due to the effects of GH and IGF-1
        - Typically normal thyroid func unless
            
            → Hyperthyroid 
            
            - IGF-1 act on thyroid follicular cells → increase TSH sensitivity
            - Co-secretion of TSH by adenoma
            
            → Hypothyroid
            
            - Mass effect on anterior pituitary
    - Ix: TFTs
        - U/S thyroid (r/o ddx/other lesions)
- Tx options for pituitary adenoma
    - Definitive management - surgery = transphenoidal hypophysectomy

            - **Visual loss (damage to optic pathway)**
            - CN damage (esp. Cn III, IV, V1, V2, VI) ⇒ occulomotor n. plasy
            - ICA damage (haemorrhage)
            - **Hypopituitarism → needs replacement hormones (15%)**
            - Stalk injury (SIADH)

    Exogenous vs Endogenous cushing syndrome 
    
    1. exogenous = iatrogenic ⇒ prolonged glucocorticoid therapy → hypercortisolism → decreased ACTH → bilateral adrenal atrophy 
    2. endogenous can be either 1’ or 2’ hypercortisolism 
        - 1’ = ACTH-independent (adrenal ACTH overprod.) Cushing syndrome
        - 2’ = ACTH-dependent (i.e. ACTH overprod.)
            - 2’ can be either pituitary adenoma or ectopic ACTH prod.
            - pituitary adenoma aka Cushing disease
            - ectopic ACTH ⇒ paraneoplastic syndrome

            - Motor (mid pons)
        - Arises from lateral surface of pons with a large sensory root (nuclei merge) (caudal) and a small motor root (cranial)
            - In middle cranial fossa, the sensory root expands into the trigeminal ganglion (lateral to cavernous sinus in a depression of the temporal bone)
                - Peripheral aspect of ganglion gives V1, V2 and V3
                - Motor root passes inferior to sensory root along the floor of this depression (distributes fibres to mandibular nerve)

- Describe the anatomy of the pupillary light reflex
    - Reflex: when a light is shone in the eye, that eye (direct) and the contralateral eye (consensual) constrict
    - Pathway
        - Optic nerve responds to light stimuli → chiasm (nasal decussation) → optic tract
            - Some fibres bypass LGN and pass in the **superior brachium to the pretectal nucleus** just above the level of the superior colliculus
        - These fibres send axons to the **Edinger-Westphal nucleus for both eyes** (PSNS for Cn III)
            - Innervates oculomotor nerve → inferior branch → ciliary ganglion → short ciliary nerves → constrictor pupillae

            - Enters IAM (petrous part of temporal) and enters the facial canal
        - In facial canal
            - Motor and sensory roots fuse to form the facial nerve
            - Geniculate ganglion formed (at bend of facial canal)
            - Branches within the facial canal

**Case:**

*A 52-year-old patient presents with drooping eyelids, blurred vision and bitemporal hemianopia. There was a diagram of the visual field quadrants – you’re asked to name this abnormality.*

- Pathophysiology and DDx for bitemporal hemianopia
    - Bitemporal hemianopia may arise from compression of the optic chiasm (location for nasal fibre decussation from each optic nerve)
        - Nasal fibres provide temporal visual fields
        - Compression → visual loss
    - DDx
        - Pituitary adenoma or hyperplasia
        - Other neoplasia
            - Benign: craniopharyngioma, meningioma
            - Malignant: pituitary carcinoma, metastases
        - Rathke’s cleft cyst
        - Pituitary abscess
        - Trauma or surgery
- Describe the visual pathway
    - Retina
        - Photoreceptor layer (rods and cones) → bipolar cells (within internal and external nuclear layer) → ganglion cells (axons make up optic nerve)
            - Rods (low light, black and white)
            - Cones (high light, colour vision)
            
            ![Screenshot 2023-08-11 at 11.51.54 am.png](Pituitary%20Adenoma%20(Anat)%201300acf2446a81c399d7f14d67055847/Screenshot_2023-08-11_at_11.51.54_am.png)
            
        - Note: macula lutea with fovea has the highest density of photoreceptors (central, high resolution))
    - Optic nerve
    - Optic chiasm
        - Location: lies on the ventral surface, just anterior to pituitary gland
        - Nasal fibres (temporal visual field) decussate at the chiasm
    - Optic tract
        - Each tract carries contralateral visual field (ipsilateral temporal, contralateral nasal)
        - Curves around cerebral peduncles to LGN of thalamus
        - Some fibres leave the tract before LGN and terminate in:
            - Pre-tectal area (light reflex)
            - Superior colliculus (orienting responses)
            - Suprachiasmic nucleus (circadian rhythm)
    - LGN of thalamus preserves input that originated from each eye
        - Layers 2, 3, 5: ipsilateral eye (temporal fibres)
        - Layers 1, 4, 6: contralateral eye (nasal fibres)
    - Optic radiation
        - Superior bundle (inferior visual field)
            - Ends in cuneus → superior to the calcarine sulcus
        - Inferior bundle (superior visual field) [Meyer’s loop]
            - Passes through temporal lobe, forms lateral wall of inferior horn of lateral ventricle
            - Inferior to calcarine sulcus (lingual gyrus)
    - Primary visual cortex
        - Located on either side of the calcarine sulcus
            - Extends onto posterolateral part of the occipital lobe
        - Central vision (macula) is represented posterior, peripheral vision is anterior
    - Processing visual information (after V1)
        - Information sent to different areas of the extra-striate visual cortex (V2, V3, V4) for higher order processing (recognising objects, colours, movement)
        - Visual association cortex extends from extra-striate cortex to include parts of the posterior parietal lobe and posterior temporal lobe
            - Dorsal (parietal) stream
                - Receives input from M-pathway to determine “where”
                    - Spatial orientation, depth perception, location, movement direction, velocity
            - Ventral (temporal) stream
                - Receives input from P-pathway to determine “what”
                    - Recognising objects, colour, form
                    - Reading text, processing words, recognising faces
                    - Learning and remember visual objects

    - Parasympathetic pathway
        - Edinger-Westphal nucleus (PSNS of CN III) in midbrain ventral to cerebral aqueduct at level of superior colliculus
            - Oculomotor nerve → inferior branch → ciliary ganglion → short ciliary nerves
- Pituitary - blood supply, venous drainage, hypophyseal portal system
    - Blood supply
        - Superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries arise from either ICA or ACA/PCA.
    - Venous drainage
        - Efferent veins → cavernous and intercavernous sinuses
    - Portal system
        - Important in hormone regulation → forms a plexus on the stalk and pars distalis
        - Hypophysiotropic hormones (derived from median eminence and other parts of hypothalamus [e.g. TRH, GnRH] act on cells of adenohypophysis
