# Peptic Ulcer Disease (Anat, Pharm)

## Case Protocol 16 – **Peptic ulcer disease**

**Case:**

*A 49-year-old male academic was admitted for investigation of vomiting and diarrhoea for the past 24 hours. In the last 3 hours he had noted that his motions had been of a black and tarry nature. He had a past history of intermittent epigastric pain. On examination the patient appeared pale and sweaty, with tenderness in the epigastrium. Rectal examination revealed black liquid faeces.*

        - Upper endoscopy to visualise sources of the bleeding (up to 3rd part of duodenum)
            - Biopsy for H. pylori or neoplasia testing

            - Lipase (DDx: pancreatitis)
            - LFT (chronic liver disease)
        - Imaging
            - Erect CXR (pneumoperitoneum if perforation)
            - Consider mesenteric angiogram if mid-gut or hind-gut bleed
- Why can you get a normochromic normocytic anaemia in PUD
    - Normochromic normocytic anaemia is consistent with acute bleeding and haemodilution (replacement of vascular volume with interstitial fluid)
        - Note: chronic bleeding → hypochromic, microcytic (Fe deficiency)
    - WCC normal [acute bleeding can cause a leukoerythroblastic picture]
    - Thrombocytosis
        - Consistent with acute bleeding
- What factors protect the gastric mucosa
    - Mucous layer with HCO3
        - Secreted from surface mucous and mucous neck cells
    - Tight junctions with adjacent epithelial cells to protect underlying layers
    - Rapid rate of cell division
        - Epithelium replaced in 3 days
    - Prostaglandins
        - Decrease gastric secretions
        - Promote mucous formation and regional blood flow
- Internal structure and cell types within the stomach
    - Internal structure
        - Stomach has two different functional regions
            - Oxyntic (body and fundus) → contains acid-secreting parietal cells
            - Pyloric (antrum) → gastrin secreting G cells
        - Lining of the stomach has rugae which represent a capacity to distend markedly in the context of food consumption
            - Each rugae lined by invaginations (pits) which open into multiple gastric glands
    - Cell types
        - Mucous neck cells
            - Produce mucus to lubricate and protect the stomach lining (neutralise acidic pH)
            - Stimulated by prostaglandins, ACh, secretin
        - Parietal cells
            - Produce HCl (convert pepsinogen to pepsin) and intrinsic factor
            - **Stimulated by ACh, gastrin, histamine**
            - Inhibited by prostaglandins, somatostatin
        - Chief cells
            - Produce pepsinogen
            - Stimulated by ACh, gastrin, secretin, VIP
        - Endocrine cells
            - G cells → gastrin (increase acid secretion and GI motility)
            - Enterochromaffin-like cells → histamine (increase acid secretion)
            - D cells → somatostatin (decrease acid secretion)
- Normal mechanism of HCl secretion in the stomach
    - Mechanism of production
        - Carbonic anhydrase catalyses the conversion of CO2 and H2O into HCO3 and H+ in gastric parietal cells
        - H+ secreted to lumen by K/H ATPase on apical membrane
        - K+ leaves apical membrane by passive diffusion (K channels)
        - HCO3 exchanged for Cl (via Cl/HCO3 exchanger on basal membrane)
        - Cl enters lumen via Cl channels on apical membrane (passive diffusion)
        - Cl- and H+ combine to form HCl
    - Regulated by neural, endocrine and paracrine control
        - Stimulation
            - Vagus nerve (ACh)
            - Gastrin acting on CCK cells
            - Histamine released from ECL cells
        - Inhibition
            - Somatostatin released by D cells in response to acidic pH, ACh, gastrin
            - Enterogastrones released by acidic pH and presence of food in duodenum
                - CCK - I cells
                - Secretin - S cells

- Pathophysiology of melaena (black tarry stools)
    - Melaena indicates upper GI bleeding (generally proximal to the ligament of Treitz - boundary of duodenum and jejunum)
        - Occurs due to oxidation of Fe-containing Hb in RBCs (correlates with transit time and acidity)
    - Distal bleeding transits too quickly to be metabolised into melaena (results in haematochezia)
    - Benign DDx: iron supplementation, activated charcoal
- Stomach - arterial supply
    - Supplied by branches of the coeliac trunk
    - Left gastric artery
        - Lesser curvature anastomosing with R gastric
    - Splenic artery
        - Short gastric arteries → fundus
        - L gastroepiploic artery → greater curvature
    - Common hepatic artery
        - R gastric artery → lesser curvature
        - Gastroduodenal
            - R gastroepiploic artery → greater curvature

Bleeding stems

***Case:** A 49yo male was admitted for investigation of vomiting and diarrhoea for the past 24hrs. In the last 3hrs, he noticed his motions had been of a black, tarry nature. He had a past hx of intermittent epigastric pain. On exam, the patient appeared pale and sweaty, with tenderness in the epigastrium. Rectal examination revealed black liquid faeces. Haemodynamic stable*

***Case:**  A 72-year-old woman is BIBA with a 2-hour history of sudden onset epigastric pain and 4 bowel motions of black tarry, offensive stools. Her past medical history includes osteoarthritis of her left hip and stable angina. She takes ibuprofen 400mg, aspirin 100mg, atorvastatin 20mg and GTN patched PRN. She has a 20-year pack history of smoking and consumes 6 standards drinks a day. On further history, she notes having similar discomfort over the past 2 years which she considered to be heart burn. On presentation, she appears distressed and in pain. Her HR is 112 and BP is 70/50, Sats 96% and RR 22.*

***Case:***

*A 50yo male presents to ED following a few months of intermittent epigastric abdominal pain and the pain has become dramatically worse in the last few hours. On exam, he has tachycardia and is hypotensive with a temperature of 37.8. He also has rebound tenderness and guarding over the whole abdomen.*

- PDx
    - Generalised peritonitis likely secondary to:
        - Perforated gastric or duodenal ulcer
        - Acute pancreatitis
        - Boerhaave’s syndrome
        - Perforated cholecystitis
    - DDx
        - Other causes: ruptured appendix, diverticulitis, bowel perforation, trauma, iatrogenic
- DDx for epigastric pain
    - GIT
        - Perforated peptic ulcer
        - Pancreatitis
        - Epigastric hernia
        - Cholecystitis
        - Hepatitis
        - GORD
        - Gastritis
    - Cardiovascular
        - Aortic dissection
        - Posterior MI
        - Mesenteric ischaemia
        - Pericarditis
    - Respiratory
        - Basal pneumonia
    - Renal
        - Pyelonephritis
        - Renal colic

- MALT lymphoma
    - Most commonly in the stomach which is strongly associated with H. pylori gastritis
        - Composed of heterogenous small B cells (centrocyte-like cells - marginal zone; monocytoid cells)
    - Pathogenesis of H. pylori gastritis
        - Infection attracts B cells, T cells and neutrophils to the mucosa
            - B cell proliferation driven by reactive T cells and cytokines
        - Chronic proliferative state of B cells and ROS production with inflammation induces oncogenic events and proliferation
