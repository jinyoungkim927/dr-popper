# Testicular cancer (Anat/Path)

*A 36-year-old businessman sought medical advice because of a painless mass in the left side of his scrotum, which had been present for three weeks. He was otherwise well apart from a history of surgical treatment for an undescended left testis as a child. Examination revealed a 5 x 3 cm, non-tender, firm mass at the upper pole of the left testis. It was possible to get above the lesion and it did not transilluminate.*

                    - Non-transilluminating
                    - Increases in size with Valsalva manouevre
                - Why is the L testicle more prone
                    - Longer course of gonadal vein and sharp angle of insertion into L renal vein
                        - Predisposes to slower drainage and increased hydrostatic pressure
                - Note: R sided varicocoele is more suspicious of RCC
            - Hydrocoele
                - Painless accumulation of fluid in the sac around the testis → derived from tunica vaginalis
                - Usually idiopathic but may be congenital
                    - Congenital
                        - Communicating hydrocoele → failure of closure of processus vaginalis
                    - Acquired
                        - Trauma, tumour, torsion
                        - Infectious → filariasis
            - Haematocoele
        - Epididymo-orchitis
        - Torsion (unlikely to be painless)
- Investigative approach to testicular cancer
    - Definitive Dx
        - Radical inguinal orchiectomy → excisional biopsy

            - **Tumour markers (staging, prognostics, monitoring recurrence)**
            - Urine MCS and PCR (gonorrhoea, chlamydia)
            - CRP or ESR
            - UEC

            - Staging
                - CT AP
                - CXR
- Is percutaneous biopsy performed in testicular cancer
    - Contraindicated due to risk of tumour seeding along the needle tract
    - Due to different lymph drainage of testes and scrotum, may lead to metastases to inguinal nodes
        - Testes → para-aortic LNs
        - Scrotum → inguinal LNs
- What US findings may be seen in testicular cancer
    - Seminoma
        - Typically well defined, hypoechoic lesions without cystic areas
    - Non-seminoma
        - Heterogenous
        - Calcifications
        - Cystic areas
        - Indistinct margins
- Risk factors for testicular cancer
    - Germ cell neoplasia in situ (premalignant)
    - Crypto-orchidism
        - Incomplete descent of testis
        - Higher risk of tumour in higher undescended testes
        - **Increased risk in both ipsilateral and contralateral testis**
    - Hypospadias
    - Personal history of testicular cancer
    - Family history → strong link
    - Other disorders
        - HIV infection
        - Androgen insensitivity syndrome
        - Peutz-Jegher syndrome

        - **Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (most common in men > 60)**
        - Non-testicular tumours (e.g. lipoma)
- Testicular cancer - staging
    - TNM staging (1-3)
        - Tumour: local invasion
        - Nodes: number involved and size
        - M: distant metastases
    - Consider serum tumour markers (B-hCG, aFP, LDH_
        - Performed after orchiectomy to define stages 1-3
- Tumour markers in testicular cancer
    - B-hCG (half-life 24-36h) and aFP (half-life 5 days) → germ cell tumours
        - Seminomas
            - B-hCG (10% positive)
            - aFP (never positive)
        - Non-seminomas
            - pB-hCG and/or aFP → 95%
                - B-hCG in choriocarcinoma
                - aFP in 90% of yolk sac tumours
    - Androgens and oestrogens may be raised in some sex cord stromal tumours (esp. Leydig)
    - LDH
        - Less specific but elevated in all GCTs (40-60%)
    - Clinical application
        - Aids presumptive Dx prior to orchiectomy
        - Post-orchiectomy prognostication (staging)
        - Monitor response to treatment
        - Monitor recurrence
- Compare seminomas and non-seminomas histology
    - Seminomas
        - Macroscopic
            - Well demarcated
            - No necrosis or haemorrhage
            - White or grey cut surface
        - Microscopic
            - Sheets of uniform polygonal cells separated by fibrous septa
                - Often associated with lymphocytic infiltrate
                - Neoplastic cells look homogenous
            - Cells have large cytoplasm and central prominent nuclei/nucleoli
                - “Fried-egg” appearance
    - Non-seminomas
        - Subtypes
            - Embryonal carcinoma
                - Ill-defined invasive masses with foci of haemorrhage and necrosis
                - Poorly differentiated, pleomorphic cells in cords, sheets or papillae
            - Yolk-sac tumour (endodermal sinus tumour)
                - Schiller-Duval bodies → resemble primitive glomeruli
            - Choriocarcinoma (most aggressive)
                - Diffuse proliferation of mononuclear (cytotrophoblasts) or multinuclear (syncytiotrophoblasts)
            - Teratoma
                - Highly variable
                - Often cystic
                - Contains derivatives from all germ cell layers
        - Compared to seminomas
            - Later stage presentation
            - More biologically aggressive (haematogenous routes)
            - Less radiosensitive
- Pathways of metastasis for seminomas and non-seminomas
    - Seminomas
        - Progress slowly and rarely metastasise (70% remain localised)
        - Primarily lymphatic spread to para-aortic nodes, mediastinal nodes, supraclavicular nodes (via thoracic duct)
    - Non-seminomas
        - Progress quickly and metastasise early
        - Primarily haematogenous spread
            - Lungs, liver, bone, brain
- Hormonal effects from testicular tumours
    - 5% of germ cell tumours present systemic endocrine effects (e.g. gynaecomastia)
        - Hormonal effects strongly associated with sex cord stromal tumours
    - Leydig cell tumours
        - Can produce androgens or oestorgen
            - Androgens = sexual precocity in boys
            - Oestrogens = gynaecomastia, impotence, loss of libido in men
    - Sertoli cell tumours
        - Predominantly oestrogen → gynaecomastia, impotence, loss of libido
    - Note: most sex cord stromal tumours are benign
    - Note: choriocarcinoma can produce excess B-hCG (hyperemesis, hyperthyroidism, gynaecomastia)
- Management of testicular cancer
    - Depends on patient and disease factors
    - May include:
        - Radical inguinal orchiectomy +/- retroperitoneal lymph node dissection
            - Primary treatment
            - Histopathology used to confirm diagnosis
        - Sperm banking and counselling prior to surgery
        - Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in some cases

- What is Prehn’s sign (testicle)
    - Positive when there is pain relief when lifting the testicle
        - More likely epididymitis > torsion
    - Inferior sign to Doppler US to rule out testicular torsion
- Embryology of reproductive tracts
    - Mesonephric (Wolffian) duct
        - Primordium for male urogenital structures (seminal vesicles, epididymis, ductus deferens)
    - Paramesonephric (Mullerian) dict
        - Primordium for female urogenital structures including fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, upper 1/3 of vagina
