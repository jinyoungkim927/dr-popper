### Past question: renal cell carcinoma (anatomy)

**Case:**

*A 60-year-old man presented to his GP with right loin pain and macroscopic haematuria. He had been feeling unwell for six weeks, had lost 6kg in weight and had felt feverish on several occasions. Examination revealed an obese, plethoric, elderly man who looked unwell.*

- Why did the renal mass not take up contrast? Phases of contrast enhancement
    - Phases
        - Arterial (15-20s after injection)
        - Portal venous (70-90s)
        - Renal
            - Corticomedullary (25-70s)
                - Contrast primarily within the cortex → not yet within tubular system
                    - Renal cortex enhances brightly > medulla
                - **Difficult to see neoplasm**
                    - **RCC demonstrates variable enhancement**
                    - This was when the CT was taken
            - Nephrogenic (100s)
                - Contrast filters through glomuli into tubules
                - Renal parenchyma enhances homogenously
