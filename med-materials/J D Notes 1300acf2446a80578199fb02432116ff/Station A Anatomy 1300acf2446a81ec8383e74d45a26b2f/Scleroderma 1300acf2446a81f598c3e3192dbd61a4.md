# Scleroderma

## Case Protocol 13 – **Scleroderma**

*A 35-year-old woman with a three year history of scleroderma presented with five weeks of increasing dysphagia. This was initially for solids and dry food, but now almost any solid food or even thick soup would cause lower chest discomfort and an inability to swallow. The patient slept on three pillows with the head of the bed raised but still experienced significant reflux each night. Despite a “good” appetite she had lost 8 kg in weight over the last 2 months.*

*On examination the patient appeared thin with tight, thickened skin on her arms, face and upper trunk. Abdominal and rectal examination were normal.*

- PDx + key Dx to exclude
    - Oesophageal dysmotility secondary to scleroderma (complicated by fibrosis and strictures)
        - Given progressive dysphagia (solids → liquids), it is more likely to be mechanical or obstructive than neurological
            - Neurological causes often present with difficulty initiating swallowing rather than food ‘getting stuck’
    - Key Dx to exclude include
        - Carcinoma of the oesophagus
        - Severe reflux oesophagitis
        - Consider infective or inflammatory causes of oesophagitis (if managed with immunosuppressants)

    - Dysphagia = subjective sensation of difficulty or abnormality of swallowing
    - DDx
        - Mechanical

- What is scleroderma (definition, components, epidemiology)
    - Systemic sclerosis or scleroderma is a connective tissue disorder characterised by excessive fibrosis (abnormal growth of CT) in multiple tissues, obliterative vascular disease (vasculopathy), and evidence of autoimmunity
    - Three main components
        - Autoimmunity (autoantibody production → anti-Scl70)
        - Inflammatory synthesis of extracellular matrix
            - Fibroblast proliferation and increased collagen synthesis
        - Non-inflammatory vasculopathy
            - Vasculopathy → tissue atrophy and fibrosis
                - Loss of lumen due to fibrosis → capillary loss and microangiopathy (obliterative)
    - Epidemiology
        - Peak onset during 30s-40s
            - F > M (4:1)
        - Family history is predictive, associated with HLA-DR1
- What are the key subtypes of scleroderma
    - Diffuse
        - Initial widespread skin involvement **(proximal to elbows and knees)**
            - Early visceral involvement and rapid progression
    - Limited (CREST)
        - Minor skin involvement (often **distal to elbow and knee)**
            - **More benign** course with potential late organ involvement
        - Features
            - Calcinosis (calcium deposits on pressure points of extremities)
            - Raynaud’s phenomenon (pallor, cyanosis, reactive hyperaemia → vasospasm)
            - Esophageal dysmotility
                - Smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis → dysmotility and decreased LES pressure
                    - Dysphagia, GORD → aspiration, Barrett’s oesophagus, strictures
            - Sclerodactyly
            - Teleangiectasia
- Clinical features of diffuse scleroderma
    - Cutaneous
        - Thickening and hardening of skin → smooth, shiny, puffy
        - **Sclerodactyly**
            - Fibrotic thickening and tightening of fingers and hands

    - Macrocytic anaemia with target cells, hypersegmented PMNs and large platelets
        - Megaloblastic anaemia secondary to folate and/or B12 deficiency. Either:
            - Malabsorption of folate (jejunum) or B12 (ileum)
            - Inhibition of intrinsic factor secretion from parietal cells
        - More likely to be folate deficiency (stores depleted quicker)
    - Raised ESR → inflammation
- Scleroderma - pathophysiology of oesophageal dysmotility
    - Atrophy and replacement of the oesophageal smooth muscle with fibrous tissue (dysphagia)
        - Reduced tone of LES → incompetence → GORD → progressive scarring or stricturing or Barret metaplasia
- Scleroderma - pathophysiology of malabsorption, weight loss, steatorrhoea
    - Scleroderma affects the small intestine where smooth muscle atrophies with accompanying fibrosis
        - Leads to impairment of peristalsis and dysmotility
    - Accompanied by:
        - Loss of microvilli and atrophy of glands
        - Increased bloating, gas, constipation and diarrhoea
            - Build-up of contents leads to bacterial overgrowth → diarrhoea and malabsorption
- Investigative approach for steatorrhoea and diarrhoea
    - Diagnostic
        - Confirm steatorrhoea
            - Faecal fat excretion (steatorrhoea = > 5g of fat in 24h on a normal diet)
            - Stool elastase for pancreatic insufficiency
        - Tests for bacterial overgrowth
            - C-14 labelled xylose or lactulose breath tests OR hydrogen breath test 2h after 50g oral glucose load

        - Barret oesophagus → metaplasia of lower oesophagus
            - Stratified squamous → simple columnar epithelium with goblet cells
            - Increased risk of adenocarcinoma
        - Erosive oesophagitis (can lead to haemorrhage into gut)
        - Aspiration pneumonia + abscess due to dysphagia
- What is GORD and common causes
    - Chronic condition where stomach contents regurgitate into the oesophagus causing irritation, inflammation and mucosal injury (heartburn)
    - Clinical features
        - Typical: retrosternal burning pain, dysphagia, odynophagia
        - Atypical: pressure sensation in chest, bloating, dyspepsia, nausea

            - **PPIs (not recommended long-term)**
                - Short-term (headache, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, abdomnal pain)
                - Long-term (hypoMg, C-difficile infection, impaired nutrient absorption → fracture risk (Ca))
        - If erosive → aim for healing with PPIs

### Memorandum: dysphagia from scleroderma (A)

*A 72-year-old woman presents with 3-week history of retrosternal pain radiating to her throat and difficulty swallowing solids and sometimes liquids. She particularly finds it difficult to keep food down. Examination reveals a mildly distressed woman.  but with no obvious physical abnormalities.*

- Oesophagus - structure, course, relations
    - The oesophagus is a muscular tube extending from the cricoid cartilage (C6) to the cardia of stomach (T10)
        - Lies anterior to the prevertebral fascia throughout its course
    - Course
        - Slightly to the left of the midline, in contact with the vertebral bodies
        - Descends until it pierces the diaphragm (T10)
        - Encircled by fibres of the R crus of diaphragm
    - Relations
        - Crossed by:
            - Aortic arch (L)
            - Azygos vein (R)
            - L main bronchus
            - R pulmonary artery
        - Passes anterior to:
            - Thoracic duct
            - Thoracic aorta (firmly connected just above diaphragm)

- Where are the oesophageal strictures
    - Four constrictions in the course of the oesophagus
        - Most likely sites for impaction of a foreign body, obstruction of instrument passage, etc.
    - Strictures:
        - Origin: cricopharyngeal constriction (C6)
        - Crossing of aortic arch (T4)
        - Crossing of L main bronchus (T5/6)
        - Hiatus of diaphragm (T10)
- Oesophagus - blood supply
    - Upper (cricoid → aortic arch)
        - Inferior thyroid artery (subclavian → thyrocervical → inferior thyroid)
    - Middle
        - Thoracic aorta branches
    - Lower
        - Left gastric artery (oesophageal branches)
