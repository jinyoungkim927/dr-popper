# Ovarian adenocarcinoma

## Case Protocol 1 - **Ovarian Adenocarcinoma**

*A 52-year-old woman was noted to have a **large mass** in the right fornix during a routine pelvic examination. She had been in good health and specific questioning regarding vaginal bleeding or abdominal symptoms was negative. There had been no change in her bowel habit and no weight loss or anorexia. The involuted uterus was anteverted, and the cervix was mobile.*

            - Genitofemoral nerve (L1-2)
            - Perineal branch of posterior femoral nerve (L2-4)
    - Clitoris supplied by dorsal nerve to the clitoris (pudendal nerve branch)
- Ovarian cancer - what would adductor weakness indicate in this case
    - Suggest involvement of the obturator nerve (which controls adductor (medial) compartment of the thigh)
    - Compression of the nerve by an ovarian lesion **is possible as it travels across the lateral aspect of the pelvic wall**
        - Leads to paraesthesias in sensory distribution + adductor weakness

- Obturator nerve - course and supply
    - Origin
        - Anterior rami of L2-L4
    - Course
        - Emerges on the medial side of psoas major muscle, near the pelvic brim
        - Continues posteriorly to the common iliac vessels and passes across the lateral pelvic wall to enter the obturator canal (in medial compartment of thigh)
        - Near the canal, **divides into anterior and posterior branches** which are separated in the medial compartment by obturator externus and adductor brevis
            - Anterior → adductor longus, adductor brevis, gracilis
                - Gives off obturator cutaneous nerve which supplies medial aspect of the thigh
            - Posterior → adductor magnus
    - Function
        - Motor
            - Obturator externus
            - Pectineus
            - Muscles of the medial thigh compartment
                - Adductor longus
                - Adductor brevis
                - Adductor magnus (adductor part)
                - Gracilis
        - Sensory
            - Skin on medial aspect of thigh
            - Articular branches to hip joint
            - Medial aspect of upper part of leg and articular branches to knee (in association with saphenous nerve)
- What is the clinical significance of pelvic floor weakening
    - Pelvic floor can be weakened by:
        - Pregnancy
        - Trauma during childbirth (perineal body tear)
        - Sustained excessive intra-abdominal pressure (e.g. obesity, chronic constipation)
    - Clinical significance
        - Uterine prolapse
            - **Weakness of the pelvic floor or uterine ligaments (esp. uterosacral ligaments)**
        - Urinary incontinence
            - **Pubococcygeus fibres (anterior fibres)** are important to elevate the neck of the bladder and control micturition
                - Anterior fibres are called levator prostatae (men)and pubovaginalis (women)
        - Faecal incontinence
            - **Puborectalis** is important to maintain the angle of the anorectal junction (90) and control defecation

- Pelvic floor dysfunction
    - Inability to relax and coordinate pelvic floor muscles correctly for micturition and defecation
    - Diagnosis
        - Physical examination
        - Urodynamic studies (+/- anorectal manometry)
    - Treatment
        - Non-surgical
            - Kegel exercises (strengthen pelvic floor)
            - Risk factor management
                - Weight loss
                - Dietary modifications to prevent constipation
                - Avoid smoking (prevent chronic cough)
            - Vaginal pessary (supports) → temporary
        - Surgical
- Lymphatic drainage of prostate (Faulkner - additional)
    - Anterior lobe
        - External iliac nodes (via paravesical space)
        - Some to inferior gluteal LNs (part of internal iliac)
    - Posterior lobe
        - Obturator nodes and external iliac nodes
            - **Lateral pathway**
            - Note: external iliac nodes also drain terminal ductus deferens and seminal vesicles
        - Internal iliac nodes (via prostatic artery)
            - **Laterodorsal pathway**
        - Pre-sacral nodes and common iliac nodes at promontory
            - **Dorsal pathway**
- Nerve supply of prostate and risk of impotence in prostate surgery
    - Innervation via prostatic plexus (inferior hypogastric plexus)
        - PSNS via pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2-S4)
            - Erection and secretomotor supply to prostatic acini
        - SNS via superior hypogastric plexus
            - Smooth muscles to stroma (ejaculation and smooth muscle contraction)
        - GVA via inferior hypogastric plexus
    - Prostate is associated by two neurovascular bundles which travel through the pelvic floor to the penis → supply to corpora cavernosa
        - Vulnerable in prostate surgery → erectile dysfunction
        - Close to peripheral zone and increase risk of spread via perineural or lymphatic pathways
