        - Early gastric cancer
            - Elevated, superficial, shallow
        - Advanced
            - Polypoid - lobulated or fungating, ulcerated
- Interpret the following CTs

    - Increased wall thickness suggestive of tumour infiltration is present at gastric cardia
    - Several perigastric, paraceliac and paraaortic lymphadenopathies
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-10-09 at 11.19.34 am.png](Gastric%20adenocarcinoma%20(Anat)%201300acf2446a8134a8bbe9d9d562efcf/Screenshot_2023-10-09_at_11.19.34_am.png)
    
    - Increased wall thickness due to tumoural infiltration is present at gastric cardia and proximal of body
        - Accompanied by perigastric fat stranding
    - Few small regional lymphadenopathies
    - Mild to moderate abdominopelvic ascites and omental thickening are present.
- Risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma
    - Non-modifiable
        - Pernicious anaemia
        - Atrophic gastritis
        - H. pylori infection
        - EBV infection
    - Modifiable
        - Smoking
- Staging gastric adenocarcinoma
    - TNM system
        - Tumour
            - T2: tumour invades muscularis propria
            - T3: invades all subserosal layers with NO invasion of visceral peritoneum
            - T4: invades serosa and adjacent structures
        - Nodes
        - Metastases
- Prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma
    - Related to stage of tumour at presentation
        - Surgical resection is the treatment for localised disease
        - Peritoneal metastases is seen in advanced stage and considered incurable
    - Aggressive tumour with 5 year survival rate < 20%
- Pathology of gastric adenocarcinoma
    - Divided into intestinal or diffuse types (Lauren classification)
        - Intestinal
            - Bulky and composed of glandular structures (similar to CRC and oesophageal adenocarcinoma)
            - Often forms an exophytic mass or ulcerated tumour
        - Diffuse
            - Infiltrative growth pattern
            - **Signet ring cell morphology**
                - Discohesive cells with large mucin vacuoles which expand the cytoplasm and push nucleus to periphery
            - **Desmoplastic reaction which stiffens the gastric wall** and causes a diffuse rugal flattening and rigid thickened wall
                - **Linitis plastica** → “leather bottle” appearance

- Lymphatic drainage of the stomach (detailed)
    - Lymphatics accompany the arteries along the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach
        - Drain from anterior and posterior surfaces to the gastric and gastro-omental (epiploic) lymph nodes
        - These nodes then drain to the coeliac lymph nodes (accompanying large arteries)
    - Drainage by location
        - Superior 2/3 of stomach → R and L gastric vessels
            - **Gastric lymph nodes**
            - Can also drain to **pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes**
        - Right 2/3 of inferior 1/3 of stomach drains via R gastroepiploic vessels
            - **Pyloric lymph nodes**
        - Left 1/3 of greater curvature drains to **pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes**

- Venous drainage of stomach (detailed)
    - Parallel the arteries in position and course:
        - R and L gastric vein → hepatic portal vein
        - Short gastric and L gastroepiploic vein → splenic vein
            - Splenic vein joins SMV to form portal vein
        - R gastroepiploic vein → SMV
        - **Prepyloric vein ascends over the pylorus to the R gastric vein**
